# d-i apt-setup/security_host string security.debian.org

### Description: Services to use:
#   Debian has two services that provide updates to releases: security and
#   release updates.
#   .
#   Security updates help to keep your system secured against attacks. Enabling
#   this service is strongly recommended.
#   .
#   Release updates provide more current versions for software that changes
#   relatively frequently and where not having the latest version could reduce
#   the usability of the software. It also provides regression fixes.
#   This service is only available for stable and oldstable releases.
#   .
#   Backported software are adapted from the development version to work with
#   this release. Although this software has not gone through such complete
#   testing as that contained in the release, it includes newer versions of
#   some applications which may provide useful features. Enabling backports
#   here does not cause any of them to be installed by default; it only
#   allows you to manually select backports to use.
# d-i apt-setup/services-select multiselect security, updates
# Possible choices: security updates (from ${SEC_HOST}), release updates, backported software

### Description: Enable source repositories in APT?
#   By default source repositories are listed in /etc/apt/sources.list (with
#   appropriate "deb-src" lines) so that "apt-get source" works. However, if
#   you don't need this feature, you can disable those entries and save some
#   bandwidth during "apt-get update" operations.

# d-i base-installer/initramfs/generator select <choice>
# Possible choices: ${GENERATORS}

### Description: Drivers to include in the initrd:
#   The primary function of an initrd is to allow the kernel to mount the
#   root file system. It therefore needs to contain all drivers and supporting
#   programs required to do that.
#   .
#   A generic initrd is much larger than a targeted one and may even be so
#   large that some boot loaders are unable to load it but has the advantage that
#   it can be used to boot the target system on almost any hardware. With the
#   smaller targeted initrd there is a very small chance that not all needed
#   drivers are included.
# d-i base-installer/initramfs-tools/driver-policy select <choice>
# Possible choices: generic: include all available drivers, targeted: only include drivers needed for this system

# d-i keyboard-configuration/unsupported_layout boolean true

### Description: Keep current keyboard options in the configuration file?
#   The current keyboard options in the configuration file
#   /etc/default/keyboard are defined as XKBOPTIONS="${XKBOPTIONS}".
#   .
#   If you choose to keep these options, no questions about the keyboard
#   options will be asked.
# d-i keyboard-configuration/unsupported_config_options boolean true

### Description: Keep default keyboard options (${XKBOPTIONS})?
#   The default value for the options of the keyboard layout is
#   XKBOPTIONS="${XKBOPTIONS}".  It is based on the currently defined
#   language/region and the settings in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.
#   .
#   If you choose to keep it, no questions about the keyboard options
#   will be asked.
# d-i keyboard-configuration/unsupported_options boolean true

### Description: Method for toggling between national and Latin mode:
#   You will need a way to toggle the keyboard between the national
#   layout and the standard Latin layout.
#   .
#   Right Alt or Caps Lock keys are often chosen for ergonomic reasons
#   (in the latter case, use the combination Shift+Caps Lock for normal Caps
#   toggle). Alt+Shift is also a popular combination; it will
#   however lose its usual behavior in Emacs and other programs
#   that use it for specific needs.
#   .
#   Not all listed keys are present on all keyboards.
# d-i keyboard-configuration/toggle select Alt+Shift
# Possible choices: Caps Lock, Right Alt (AltGr), Right Control, Right Shift, Right Logo key, Menu key, Alt+Shift, Control+Shift, Control+Alt, Alt+Caps Lock, Left Control+Left Shift, Left Alt, Left Control, Left Shift, Left Logo key, Scroll Lock key, No toggling

### Description: Method for temporarily toggling between national and Latin input:
#   When the keyboard is in national mode and one wants to type only a few
#   Latin letters, it might be more appropriate to switch temporarily to
#   Latin mode. The keyboard remains in that mode as long as the chosen key is
#   kept pressed. That key may also be used to input national letters when
#   the keyboard is in Latin mode.
#   .
#   You can disable this feature by choosing "No temporary switch".
# d-i keyboard-configuration/switch select No temporary switch
# Possible choices: No temporary switch, Both Logo keys, Right Alt (AltGr), Right Logo key, Left Alt, Left Logo key

### Description: Key to function as AltGr:
#   With some keyboard layouts, AltGr is a modifier key used to input
#   some characters, primarily ones that are unusual for the language of the
#   keyboard layout, such as foreign currency symbols and accented letters.
#   These are often printed as an extra symbol on keys.
# d-i keyboard-configuration/altgr select Right Alt (AltGr)
# Possible choices: The default for the keyboard layout, No AltGr key, Right Alt (AltGr), Right Control, Right Logo key, Menu key, Left Alt, Left Logo key, Keypad Enter key, Both Logo keys, Both Alt keys

### Description: Compose key:
#   The Compose key (known also as Multi_key) causes the computer to interpret
#   the next few keystrokes as a combination in order to produce a character
#   not found on the keyboard.
#   .
#   On the text console the Compose key does not work in Unicode mode. If not
#   in Unicode mode, regardless of what you choose here, you can always also
#   use the Control+period combination as a Compose key.
# d-i keyboard-configuration/compose select No compose key
# Possible choices: No compose key, Right Alt (AltGr), Right Control, Right Logo key, Menu key, Left Logo key, Caps Lock

### Description: Use Control+Alt+Backspace to terminate the X server?
#   By default the combination Control+Alt+Backspace does nothing.  If
#   you want it can be used to terminate the X server.
# d-i keyboard-configuration/ctrl_alt_bksp boolean false

### Description: Keymap to use:
# d-i keyboard-configuration/xkb-keymap select <choice>

#   When your computer boots, you will be able to choose to load one of these
#   operating systems or the newly installed Debian system.
# d-i grub-installer/with_other_os boolean true

### Description: Install the GRUB boot loader to your primary drive?
#   It seems that this new installation is the only operating system
#   on this computer. If so, it should be safe to install the GRUB boot loader
#   to your primary drive (UEFI partition/boot record).
#   .
#   Warning: If your computer has another operating system that the installer
#   failed to detect, this will make that operating system temporarily
#   unbootable, though GRUB can be manually configured later to boot it.
# d-i grub-installer/only_debian boolean true

### Description: Install the GRUB boot loader to the Serial ATA RAID disk?
#   Installation of GRUB on Serial ATA RAID is experimental.
#   .
#   GRUB is always installed to the master boot record (MBR) of the
#   Serial ATA RAID disk. It is also assumed that disk is listed as the
#   first hard disk in the boot order defined in the system's BIOS setup.
#   .
#   The GRUB root device is: ${GRUBROOT}.
# d-i grub-installer/sataraid boolean true

### Description: Install the GRUB boot loader to the multipath device?
#   Installation of GRUB on multipath is experimental.

#   device in the system's FibreChannel adapter BIOS.
#   .
#   The GRUB root device is: ${GRUBROOT}.
# d-i grub-installer/multipath boolean true

### Description: Device for boot loader installation:
#   You need to make the newly installed system bootable, by installing
#   the GRUB boot loader on a bootable device. The usual way to do this is to
#   install GRUB to your primary drive (UEFI partition/boot record). You may
#   instead install GRUB to a different drive (or partition), or to removable
#   media.
#   .
#   The device notation should be specified as a device in /dev. Below are some
#   examples:
#    - "/dev/sda" will install GRUB to your primary drive (UEFI partition/boot
#      record);
#    - "/dev/sdb" will install GRUB to a secondary drive (which may for instance
#      be a thumbdrive);
#    - "/dev/fd0" will install GRUB to a floppy.
# d-i grub-installer/bootdev string <string>

### Description: Device for boot loader installation:

### Description: GRUB password:
#   The GRUB boot loader offers many powerful interactive features, which could
#   be used to compromise your system if unauthorized users have access to the
#   machine when it is starting up. To defend against this, you may choose a
#   password which will be required before editing menu entries or entering the
#   GRUB command-line interface. By default, any user will still be able to
#   start any menu entry without entering the password.
#   .
#   If you do not wish to set a GRUB password, leave this field blank.
# d-i grub-installer/password password <password>

### Description: Install GRUB?
#   GRUB 2 is the next generation of GNU GRUB, the boot loader that is commonly
#   used on i386/amd64 PCs. It is now also available for ${ARCH}.
#   .
#   It has interesting new features but is still experimental software
#   for this architecture. If you choose to install it, you should be prepared
#   for breakage, and have an idea on how to recover your system if it
#   becomes unbootable. You're advised not to try this in production

# d-i grub-installer/make_active boolean true

### Description: Force GRUB installation to the EFI removable media path?
#   It seems that this computer is configured to boot via EFI, but maybe
#   that configuration will not work for booting from the hard
#   drive. Some EFI firmware implementations do not meet the EFI
#   specification (i.e. they are buggy!) and do not support proper
#   configuration of boot options from system hard drives.
#   .
#   A workaround for this problem is to install an extra copy of the EFI
#   version of the GRUB boot loader to a fallback location, the
#   "removable media path". Almost all EFI systems, no matter how buggy,
#   will boot GRUB that way.
#   .
#   Warning: If the installer failed to detect another operating system
#   that is present on your computer that also depends on this fallback,
#   installing GRUB there will make that operating system temporarily
#   unbootable. GRUB can be manually configured later to boot it if
#   necessary.

#   prefer, the installer can mount filesystems based on the traditional device
#   names, or based on a label you assign. However, note that traditional
#   device names may change based on the order in which the kernel discovers
#   devices at boot, which may cause the wrong filesystem to be mounted;
#   similarly, labels are likely to clash if you plug in a new disk or a USB
#   drive, and if that happens your system's behaviour when started will be
#   random.
#   .
#   If you set "label" here, any filesystems without a label will be mounted

# d-i passwd/root-login boolean true

### Description: Root password:
#   You need to set a password for 'root', the system administrative
#   account. A malicious or unqualified user with root access can have
#   disastrous results, so you should take care to choose a root password
#   that is not easy to guess. It should not be a word found in dictionaries,

#   .
#   A good password will contain a mixture of letters, numbers and punctuation
#   and should be changed at regular intervals.
#   .
#   The root user should not have an empty password. If you leave this
#   empty, the root account will be disabled and the system's initial user
#   account will be given the power to become root using the "sudo"
#   command.

### Description: Create a normal user account now?
#   It's a bad idea to use the root account for normal day-to-day activities,
#   such as the reading of electronic mail, because even a small mistake can
#   result in disaster. You should create a normal user account to use for
#   those day-to-day tasks.

# d-i passwd/user-fullname string <string>

### Description: Username for your account:

### Description: Enable shadow passwords?
#   Shadow passwords make your system more secure because nobody is able to

#   saves these values in the configuration file /etc/default/adjtimex so the
#   settings will be restored on every boot, when /etc/init.d/adjtimex runs.
#   .
#   The script takes 70 seconds to run, so running it for every upgrade
#   may be a waste of time. Alternatively, you can run adjtimexconfig

### Description: Set up a database for this package?
#   No database has been set up for this package. Before continuing, you should

#   .
#    * the type of database that you want to use - generally the MySQL backend
#      (which is compatible with MariaDB) is a good choice, and other
#      implementations like PostgreSQL or SQLite are often problematic with
#      OpenStack (this depends on the service);
#    * the database server hostname (that server must allow TCP connections from
#      this machine);
#    * a username and password to access the database.
#   .
#   Note that if you plan on using a remote database server, you must first
#   configure dbconfig-common to do so (using dpkg-reconfigure dbconfig-common),
#   and the remote database server needs to be configured with adequate
#   credentials.
#   .
#   If some of these requirements are missing, do not choose this option. Run
#   with regular SQLite support instead.

#### apt-cacher-ng_3.6.4-1_amd64.deb
############################

### Description: Automatic remapping of client requests:
#   Apt-Cacher NG can download packages from repositories other than those
#   requested by the clients. This allows it to cache content effectively,
#   and makes it easy for an administrator to switch to another mirror later.
#   The URL remapping can be set up automatically, using a configuration
#   based on the current state of /etc/apt/sources.list.
#   .
#   Please specify whether the remapping should be configured once now, or
#   reconfigured on every update of Apt-Cacher NG (modifying the
#   configuration files each time), or left unconfigured.
#   .
#   Selecting "No automated setup" will leave the existing configuration
#   unchanged. It will need to be updated manually.
# d-i apt-cacher-ng/gentargetmode select Set up once
# Possible choices: Set up once, Set up now and update later, No automated setup

### Description: Listening address(es) for Apt-Cacher NG:
#   Please specify the local addresses that Apt-Cacher NG should listen on
#   (multiple entries must be separated by spaces).
#   .
#   Each entry must be an IP address or hostname associated with a local
#   network interface. Generic protocol-specific addresses are also
#   supported, such as 0.0.0.0 for listening on all IPv4-enabled interfaces.
#   .
#   If this field is left empty, Apt-Cacher NG will listen on all
#   interfaces, with all supported protocols.
#   .
#   The special word "keep" keeps the value from the current (or default)
#   configuration unchanged.
# d-i apt-cacher-ng/bindaddress string keep

### Description: Listening TCP port:
#   Please specify the TCP port that Apt-Cacher NG should listen on for
#   incoming HTTP (proxy) requests. The default value is port 3142, but it
#   can be set to 9999 to emulate apt-proxy.
#   .
#   If this field is left empty, the value from the current configuration
#   remains unchanged.
# d-i apt-cacher-ng/port string keep

### Description: Top-level directory for package cache:
#   The main cache storage directory should be located on a file system without
#   file name restrictions.
#   .
#   If this field is left empty, the value from the current configuration
#   remains unchanged or is set to the default of /var/cache/apt-cacher-ng.
# d-i apt-cacher-ng/cachedir string keep

### Description: Proxy to use for downloads:
#   Please specify the proxy server to use for downloads.
#   .
#   Username and password for the proxy server can be included here following the
#   user:pass@host:port scheme. However, please check the documentation for limitations.
#   .
#   If this field is left empty, Apt-Cacher NG will not use any proxy
#   server.
#   .
#   The special word "keep" keeps the value from the current (or default)
#   configuration unchanged.
# d-i apt-cacher-ng/proxy string keep

### Description: Allow HTTP tunnels through Apt-Cacher NG?
#   Apt-Cacher NG can be configured to allow users to create HTTP tunnels,
#   which can be used to access remote servers that might otherwise be
#   blocked by (for instance) a firewall filtering HTTPS connections.
#   .
#   This feature is usually disabled for security reasons; enable it only for
#   trusted LAN environments.
# d-i apt-cacher-ng/tunnelenable boolean false

############################
#### apt-listchanges_3.24_all.deb
############################

### Description: Method to be used to display changes:
#   Changes in packages can be displayed in various ways by apt-listchanges:
#   .
#    pager        : display changes one page at a time;
#    browser      : display HTML-formatted changes using a web browser;
#    xterm-pager  : like pager, but in an xterm in the background;
#    xterm-browser: like browser, but in an xterm in the background;
#    gtk          : display changes in a GTK window;
#    text         : print changes to the terminal (without pausing);
#    mail         : only send changes via e-mail;
#    none         : do not run automatically from APT.
#   .
#   This setting can be overridden at execution time. By default, all the
#   options except for 'none' will also send copies by mail.
# d-i apt-listchanges/frontend select pager
# Possible choices: pager, browser, xterm-pager, xterm-browser, gtk, text, mail, none

### Description: E-mail address(es) which will receive changes:
#   Optionally, apt-listchanges can e-mail a copy of displayed changes to
#   a specified address.
#   .
#   Multiple addresses may be specified, delimited by commas. Leaving this
#   field empty disables mail notifications.
# d-i apt-listchanges/email-address string root

### Description: Format of e-mail messages:
#   Please choose a format for e-mail copies of the displayed changes -
#   either plain text or HTML with clickable links.
# d-i apt-listchanges/email-format select text
# Possible choices: text, html

### Description: Prompt for confirmation after displaying changes?
#   After displaying the list of changes, apt-listchanges can pause with
#   a confirmation prompt. This is useful when running from APT, as it
#   offers an opportunity to abort the upgrade if a change is unwelcome.
#   .
#   This can be overridden at execution time, and has no effect if the
#   configured frontend option is 'mail' or 'none'.
# d-i apt-listchanges/confirm boolean false

### Description: Insert headers before changelogs?
#   apt-listchanges can insert a header before each package's changelog
#   showing the name of the package, and the names of the binary packages
#   which are being upgraded (when different from the source package name).
#   .
#   Note however that displaying headers might make the output a bit harder
#   to read as they might contain long lists of names of binary packages.
# d-i apt-listchanges/headers boolean false

### Description: Disable retrieving changes over network?
#   In rare cases when a binary package does not contain a changelog file,
#   apt-listchanges by default executes the command "apt-get changelog",
#   which tries to download changelog entries from the network.
#   .
#   This option can disable this behavior, which might for example be
#   useful for systems with limited network connectivity.
# d-i apt-listchanges/no-network boolean false

### Description: Show changes in reverse order?
#   By default apt-listchanges shows changes for each package in the order
#   of their appearance in the relevant changelog or news files - from the
#   most recent version of the package to the oldest.
#   .
#   Optionally apt-listchanges can display changes in the opposite order,
#   which some may find more natural: from the oldest changes in the
#   package to the newest.
# d-i apt-listchanges/reverse boolean false

### Description: Should apt-listchanges skip changes that have already been seen?
#   A record of already displayed changes can be kept in order to avoid
#   displaying them again. This is useful, for example, when retrying an upgrade.
# d-i apt-listchanges/save-seen boolean true

### Description: Changes displayed with APT:
#   Please choose which type of changes should be displayed with APT.
#   .
#    news      : important news items only;
#    changelogs: detailed changelogs only;
#    both      : news and changelogs.
# d-i apt-listchanges/which select news
# Possible choices: news, changelogs, both

############################
#### apt-listdifferences_1.20190206_all.deb
############################

### Description: Initialize the apt-listdifferences source packages database now?
#   The source packages database for apt-listdifferences can be initialized now.
#   Depending on your Internet connection, this may take a while, but it will also
#   provide immediate functionality for the tool.
#   .
#   If you do not choose this option, apt-listdifferences will instead become functional slowly
#   over time as more and more reference source packages get added to its database
#   when they are first seen.
# d-i apt-listdifferences/initialize boolean true

### Description: Remove the apt-listdifferences source packages database?
#   The apt-listdifferences source packages database is currently still present on disk. You can save
#   a lot of space by removing it now, but if you ever plan to reinstall
#   apt-listdifferences, the data will need to be downloaded again.
# d-i apt-listdifferences/purge boolean false

############################
#### arno-iptables-firewall_2.1.1-2_all.deb
############################

### Description: External network interfaces:
#   The external network interfaces connect this machine
#   to untrusted networks (e.g. the Internet). The firewall will only permit
#   connections attempts with explicitly allowed source/destination-port
#   combinations on these interfaces. You have to specify all external
#   interfaces (e.g. eth0 and/or ppp0).
#   .
#   For a ppp-interface that doesn't exist yet you can use the wildcard device
#   called "ppp+", but you can only use ppp+ if there aren't any other ppp
#   interfaces!
#   .
#   If no interfaces are specified here, no firewall setup will
#   be performed.
#   .
#   Multiple interfaces should be specified space separated.
# d-i arno-iptables-firewall/config-ext-if string ppp+

### Description: Is DHCP used on external interfaces?
#   This machine might use DHCP to dynamically obtain its IP address from
#   your Internet service provider (ISP). This will be almost always the case
#   if you have a non-permanent (e.g. dialup) connection.
#   .
#   If DHCP is not explicitly enabled, the firewall will block all DHCP-related
#   network traffic.
#   .
#   Leave this enabled, if you are unsure.
# d-i arno-iptables-firewall/dynamic-ip boolean true

### Description: Open external TCP-ports:
#   The default firewall policy is to deny all incoming traffic on the
#   external interfaces. If this machine provides services to the outside
#   world (e.g. the Internet) they have to be explicitly enabled.
#   .
#   Please specify the TCP-ports numbers associated with the services that
#   shall be accessible from the outside world. Some frequently used ports are: 80
#   (http), 443 (https) or 22 (ssh).
#   .
#   In addition to single port numbers you may also specify port ranges (e.g.
#   10000:11000). Multiple entries should be entered space separated.
#   .
#   If unsure, leave this empty.
# d-i arno-iptables-firewall/services-tcp string <string>

### Description: Open external UDP-ports:
#   The default firewall policy is to deny all incoming traffic on the
#   external interfaces. If this machine provides services for the outside
#   world (e.g. the Internet) they have to be explicitly enabled.
#   .
#   Please specify the UDP-ports numbers associated with the services that
#   shall be accessible from the outside world.
#   .
#   In addition to single port numbers you may also specify port ranges (e.g.
#   10000:11000). Multiple entries should be entered space separated.
#   .
#   If unsure, leave this empty.
# d-i arno-iptables-firewall/services-udp string <string>

### Description: Should the firewall be (re)started now?
#   For security reasons the new firewall setup is not applied
#   automatically. You might want to perform a manual inspection of the
#   firewall configuration in /etc/arno-iptables-firewall/firewall.conf, especially
#   when upgrading to a new version, as configuration variables might have changed.
#   .
#   In order to later manually apply the new
#   firewall settings before the next reboot, invoke 'invoke-rc.d
#   arno-iptables-firewall start'.
#   .
#   If you do not need manual inspection, the firewall-setup can be applied now.
# d-i arno-iptables-firewall/restart boolean true

### Description: Do you want to enable NAT?
#   If the connected internal networks should be able to access the outside
#   world (e.g. the Internet) through the firewall, masquerading (NAT) has
#   to be enabled.
#   .
#   When in doubt, you can safely leave this disabled.
# d-i arno-iptables-firewall/nat boolean false

### Description: Internal network interfaces:
#   The internal network interfaces connect this machine
#   to trusted networks (e.g. the office or home LAN). The firewall will permit
#   all connection attempts on these interfaces. If you specify such interfaces,
#   you will be able to permit the internal networks to access the Internet through
#   this host. If there are no such interfaces, leave this empty.
#   .
#   Multiple interfaces should be entered space separated.
# d-i arno-iptables-firewall/config-int-if string <string>

### Description: Internal subnets:
#   You have to specify which subnets are connected to the internal network
#   interfaces. Hosts in the internal networks can connect to all the services on
#   this machine.
#   .
#   Give subnets in CIDR notation (e.g. 192.168.1.0/24). If you have
#   multiple internal networks, they should be space separated.
# d-i arno-iptables-firewall/config-int-net string <string>

### Description: Internal networks with access to external networks:
#   If you want to restrict the access to the external networks, you can specify
#   the allowed internal subnets in CIDR notation (e.g. 192.168.1.0/24). It is
#   also possible to specify single hosts by their IP addresses. If you have
#   multiple internal networks and/or hosts, they should be given space separated.
#   .
#   If you leave this empty, the value is automatically set to equal the internal
#   network. Therefore the WHOLE internal network will have access to the external
#   networks, so be careful to only specify networks that should have access to
#   the outside world.
#   .
#   If you are unsure, leave this empty.
# d-i arno-iptables-firewall/config-int-nat-net string <string>

### Description: Should the machine be pingable from the outside world?
#   For increased security the firewall can be setup to ignore ICMP echo
#   requests (pings). While this is generally a good idea (the host seems to
#   be down at a first glance), this is sometimes not useful (e.g. failure
#   diagnostics).
#   .
#   If you are not sure, leave this disabled.
# d-i arno-iptables-firewall/icmp-echo boolean false

### Description: Do you want to manage the firewall setup with debconf?
#   A basic firewall setup that is suitable for most purposes can be created by
#   answering a few questions. This should be the preferred option for all who are
#   not familiar with firewall-related topics.
#   .
#   If you do not want that, the firewall will not work before you have edited
#   the configuration manually.
# d-i arno-iptables-firewall/debconf-wanted boolean true

### Description: Remove deprecated file /etc/cron.d/backup-manager?
#   In previous version, backup-manager uses /etc/cron.d directory but this directory is not
#   handled by anacron. Thus, it is not possible to run backup-manager's job asynchronously, if
#   cron.d is used.
#   .
#   In order to let anacron handle backup-manager's job, the following CRON subdirectories are used:
#   /etc/cron.daily, /etc/cron.weekly and /etc/cron.monthly, depending on the chosen frequency.
#   .
#   As jobs handled by the cron.d subdirectory may be skipped if the system is not running,
#   it is recommended to use one of those directories instead.
# d-i backup-manager/cron_d_remove_deprecated boolean false

### Description: Encrypt archives?
#   If you don't trust the physical device where you store your data, you may want
#   to be sure that your archives won't be accessible by a malicious user.
#   .
#   Backup Manager can encrypt your archives with GPG, that means that you will
#   need a GPG identity to use that feature.
# d-i backup-manager/enable_encryption boolean false

### Description: GPG recipient:
#   You have to set the recipient for which the archive is encrypted. A valid
#   specification is a short or long key id, or a descriptive name, as explained
#   in the gpg man page.
#   .
#   The public key for this identity must be in the key ring of the user running gpg,
#   which may be root in most of the cases.

#    * a username and password to access the database.
#   .
#   Note that if you plan on using a remote database server, you must first
#   configure dbconfig-common to do so (using dpkg-reconfigure dbconfig-common),
#   and the remote database server needs to be configured with adequate
#   credentials.
#   .
#   If some of these requirements are missing, do not choose this option. Run

#### bilibop-rules_0.6.3_amd64.deb
############################

### Description: Do you intend to install bilibop-rules on a Live System ?
#   Some bilibop-rules settings can be useful on non-volatile Operating Systems,
#   when running from a removable and writable media (USB sticks, external HDD
#   or SD cards); but they are currently useless or even harmful for LiveCD or
#   LiveUSB systems.
#   .
#   If you choose this option, no other question will be asked; bilibop udev
#   rules will be applied but nothing else will be modified on your system.
#   Note that in that case, this package is overkill and you should probably
#   replace it by the lighter but as much as efficient bilibop-udev package.
# d-i bilibop-rules/on-live-system boolean false

### Description: Do you want to use custom bilibop rules and build them now ?
#   If tens of removable media are plugged on the computer your system boots
#   from, bilibop udev rules can significantly increase boot time. This can be
#   avoided by using custom udev rules, which are specific to the device your
#   system is installed on.
#   .
#   That said, if this device can boot from different hardware port types (as
#   USB/Firewire, USB/eSATA, USB/MMC/SD, etc.), you should check the resulting
#   rules by booting your system on the alternative port type, and if necessary
#   by running 'dpkg-reconfigure bilibop-rules' again with proper options, or
#   even by editing '/etc/udev/rules.d/66-bilibop.rules'.
# d-i bilibop-rules/bilibop_rules_generator/customize boolean false

### Description: What do you want to do with your custom rules ?
#   The file '/etc/udev/rules.d/66-bilibop.rules' exists. It is specific to the
#   drive on which your system is installed and overrides the one, more generic,
#   that is provided by the bilibop-rules package (in '/usr/lib/udev/rules.d').
#   .
#   If the device hosting the running system is able to boot from different
#   hardware port types (USB/Firewire, USB/eSATA, USB/MMC/SD-card, etc.), you
#   should boot it from the alternative port type and check if your custom rules
#   work fine in all cases. In the doubt, you should remove the custom rules
#   file.
# d-i bilibop-rules/bilibop_rules_generator/overwrite select keep
# Possible choices: keep existing custom rules, rebuild custom rules, remove custom rules

### Description: Options to pass to the bilibop rules generator:
#   Possible options you can pass to the bilibop rules generator are the
#   followings:
#   .
#    -a vendor,model
#    -a manufacturer,product,serial
#    -e ID_VENDOR,ID_MODEL,ID_SERIAL_SHORT
#    -e ID_SERIAL
#   .
#   The two first ones cannot be mixed; for example, '-a model,serial' is not a
#   valid option; use '-a model -e ID_SERIAL' instead. In the doubt, you should
#   probably set it to an empty string (defaults to
#   '-a manufacturer,product,serial').
# d-i bilibop-rules/bilibop_rules_generator/options string <string>

### Description: Do you want to hide Physical Volumes your system does not need ?
#   It seems that the drive on which your system is installed contains Logical
#   Volumes. It is possible to set LVM to activate only the Physical Volumes
#   that your system needs. This can mainly avoid name conflicts between the
#   Volumes used by your system and those that could be found on internal or
#   external drives plugged on the same computer.
#   .
#   If you choose to use this feature, this will overwrite '/etc/lvm/lvm.conf',
#   and you should read 'README.Debian' in the documentation of the package.
#   Otherwise, you can do it later with
#   .
#    dpkg-reconfigure -p low bilibop-rules
# d-i bilibop-rules/physical_volumes_filter/system-only boolean false

# d-i boxbackup-client/debconf boolean false

### Description: Run mode for the BoxBackup client:
#   The BoxBackup client supports two modes of backup:
#   .
#   In the 'lazy' mode, the backup daemon will regularly scan the file system
#   searching for modified files. It will then upload the files older than a
#   specified age to the backup server.
#   .
#   In the 'snapshot' mode the backup will be explicitly run at regular intervals.
#   A cron file (/etc/cron.d/boxbackup-client) is provided with the
#   package and should be adapted to suit your needs.
# d-i boxbackup-client/backupMode select <choice>
# Possible choices: lazy, snapshot

### Description: Account number for this node on the backup server:
#   The administrator of the BoxBackup server should have assigned this client
#   a hexadecimal account number.
#   .
#   If no account number has been assigned yet, leave this field blank and
#   configure it later by running 'dpkg-reconfigure boxbackup-client' as root.

### Description: Interval (in seconds) between directory scans:
#   BoxBackup regularly scans the selected directories, looking for modified
#   files.
#   .
#   Please choose the scan interval in seconds.
# d-i boxbackup-client/UpdateStoreInterval string 3600

### Description: Minimum time to wait (in seconds) before uploading a file:
#   A file will be uploaded to the server only after a certain time after its
#   last modification.
#   .
#   Low interval values will trigger frequent uploads to the server and more
#   revisions being created with older revisions being removed earlier.
# d-i boxbackup-client/MinimumFileAge string 21600

### Description: Maximum time to wait (in seconds) before uploading a file:
#   Frequently modified files are likely to never get uploaded if they
#   never reach the minimum wait time.
#   .
#   Please enter the maximum time to reach before the upload of a modified
#   file to the server is enforced.
# d-i boxbackup-client/MaxUploadWait string 86400

### Description: Recipient for alert notifications:
#   The BoxBackup client sends alert notifications when a problem occurs
#   during the backup.
#   .
#   Please enter either a local user name (for example 'root') or an email
#   address (for example 'admin@example.org').
# d-i boxbackup-client/notifyMail string root

### Description: Generate the client private key and X.509 certificate request?
#   The BoxBackup client needs an RSA private key and the corresponding X.509
#   certificate to authenticate itself with the server.
#   .
#   Both can be generated automatically. You will need to send the
#   certificate request to the BoxBackup server administrator who will
#   sign it and send it back to you along with the server's Certification
#   Authority certificate.
#   .
#   These files should be copied into BoxBackup's configuration
#   directory. The file names to use are given in the
#   /etc/boxbackup/bbackupd.conf file.

### Description: Should BoxBackup be configured automatically?
#   The package configuration scripts can create the configuration files
#   for the BoxBackup server.
#   .
#   You should choose this option if you are not familiar with BoxBackup's
#   configuration options. The configuration can be done manually with the
#   'raidfile-config' and 'bbstored-config' scripts.
#   .
#   The server will not start if it is not configured. In all cases,
#   reading the /usr/share/doc/boxbackup-server/README.Debian is
#   recommended.
# d-i boxbackup-server/debconf boolean false

### Description: Location of the RAID directories:
#   Please choose the location for the three RAID file directories.
#   .
#   To enable RAID, the directory names should be a space-separated list of
#   three partitions, each on different physical hard drives (for example:
#   '/raid/0.0 /raid/0.1 /raid/0.2').
#   .
#   If you don't want to enable RAID, just specify the path to one directory

### Description: Block size for the userland RAID system:
#   BoxBackup uses userland RAID techniques.
#   .
#   Please choose the block size to use for the storage.
#   For maximum efficiency, you should choose the block size of the underlying
#   file system (which can be displayed for ext2 filesystems with the 'tune2fs -l'
#   command).
#   .
#   This value should be set even if you don't plan to use RAID.
# d-i boxbackup-server/raidBlockSize string 4096

### Description: Generate a server private key and X.509 certificate request?
#   The BoxBackup server needs an RSA private key and the corresponding X.509
#   certificate to perform client-server authentication and communication
#   encryption.
#   .
#   Both can be generated automatically. You will need to sign the
#   certificate with your root CA (see the boxbackup-server package) and

#   then one single log entry is generated for the message and, in case the
#   message is determined to be malicious, the command indicated by VirusAction
#   is executed just once. In both cases only the last recipient is reported.
#   If SupportMultipleRecipients is on:
#   then one line is logged for each recipient and the command indicated
#   by VirusAction is also executed once for each recipient.
#   .
#   Note: although it's probably a good idea to enable this option, the default value
#   is currently set to off for legacy reasons.

#   this option is set, the installation process will also update the ownership
#   and permissions of the quarantine and run directories.
# d-i clamsmtp/addusergroup boolean true

### Description: Fix directory permissions?
#   clamsmtpd needs read and write permissions to the virus spool directory,
#   and the run directory in which its PID file is created.  Additionally, the
#   Clam AV daemon must have read access to the spool directory to scan for
#   viruses.
#   .
#   The post-installation script can fix the permissions and ownership of these
#   two directories.  It will consult the /etc/clamsmtpd.conf file for the
#   administratively assigned TempDirectory, PidFile, User, and Group variables,
#   and then update the two directories appropriately.
#   .
#   Be sure to check directory permissions after running the init script with the

#   .
#   Note that if you plan on using a remote database server, you must first
#   configure dbconfig-common to do so (using dpkg-reconfigure dbconfig-common),

#   Setting this to true will edit /etc/conserver/console.cf
#   and replace CONSERVER_MASTER and CONSERVER_PORT with the
#   configured values in the next questions
# d-i conserver-client/config boolean true

### Description: Hostname where your conserver server is installed:
#   The conserver hostname is the hostname where the conserver-server
#   package is installed. The client, 'console', will use the hostname 'console'
#   if left empty. The server name can be changed during runtime with
#   the -M option.
# d-i conserver-client/server string localhost

### Description: The server port number to connect to:
#   Set the conserver server port to connect to. This may be either a port
#   number or a service name.

#   conserver is 782, must be higher than 1024 if running as non-root.
# d-i conserver-server/port string 3109

### Description: The base port number for the conserver children:
#   Set the base port for children to listen on. Each child starts looking for
#   free ports at this port number and working upward, trying a maximum number
#   of ports equal to twice the maximum number of groups. If no free ports are
#   available in that range, conserver exits. By default, conserver lets the
#   operating system choose a free port.
#   Empty input selects the default.
#   (Conserver forks a child for each group of consoles it must manage and
#   assigns each process a port number to listen on.)
# d-i conserver-server/base_port string <string>

### Description: The listen address (defaults to all addresses if empty):
#   Set the address to listen on.  This allows conserver to bind to a
#   particular IP address (like `127.0.0.1') instead of all interfaces. The
#   default is to bind to all interfaces.
# d-i conserver-server/listen_address string <string>

### Description: Should conserver run as root?
#   Conserver can be configured to run as root or as 'conservr'. It is not
#   possible to use the shadow password if running as non-root in
#   conserver.passwd. (See the manual for conserver.passwd for more details.)

### Description: Method for temporarily toggling between national and Latin input:
#   When the keyboard is in national mode and one wants to type only a few
#   Latin letters, it might be more appropriate to switch temporarily to
#   Latin mode. The keyboard remains in that mode as long as the chosen key is
#   kept pressed. That key may also be used to input national letters when

#   With some keyboard layouts, AltGr is a modifier key used to input
#   some characters, primarily ones that are unusual for the language of the
#   keyboard layout, such as foreign currency symbols and accented letters.
#   These are often printed as an extra symbol on keys.
# d-i keyboard-configuration/altgr select Right Alt (AltGr)

### Description: Do you want CUPS to print unknown jobs as raw jobs?
#   The Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) enforces a MIME type for all
#   print jobs. Since not all sources of print jobs can attach an
#   appropriate type, many jobs get submitted as the MIME type
#   application/octet-stream and could be rejected if CUPS cannot guess
#   the job's format.
#   .
#   CUPS can handle all such jobs as "raw" jobs, which causes them to be
#   sent directly to the printer without processing.
#   .
#   It is recommended to choose this option if the server will be
#   accepting print jobs from Windows computers or Samba servers.
# d-i cupsys/raw-print boolean true

### Description: Printer communication backends:

#### cvsd_1.0.24+b1_amd64.deb
############################

### Description: Location of chroot jail:
#   cvsd can run in a chroot jail. This is the preferred method of
#   operation. Specify the location of the chroot jail. If you make this
#   'none' no chroot jail will be created and used.
#   A chroot file hierarchy will be created in the specified location.
# d-i cvsd/rootjail string /var/lib/cvsd

### Description: The maximum number of connections that can be handled:
#   It is possible to specify a maximum number of connections that cvsd
#   can handle simultaneously. Specifying 0 (zero) will put no limit to
#   the number of connections.
# d-i cvsd/maxconnections string 10

### Description: Nice value cvsd should run at:
#   cvsd can be run at reduced priority so it will not take up too
#   many resources, especially if a user specifies a -z option to cvs.
#   The priority can also be increased (negative value here).
# d-i cvsd/nice string 1

### Description: Umask cvsd should run at:
#   Specify the umask cvsd and cvs should use when creating files.
#   .
#   The umask should be specified as an octal value and represents
#   the permissions that should be taken away when creating a file
#   (e.g. using 027 will create files with mode 640 or rw-r-----).
# d-i cvsd/umask string 027

### Description: Address and port on which cvsd will listen:
#   With the first argument you can specify the address cvsd should listen on.
#   The '*' address specifies that cvsd should listen on all addresses.
#   You can specify a IPv4 address, IPv6 address, a hostname or '*'.
#   .
#   The second argument is the service name (e.g. cvspserver) or port number
#   (default 2401) cvsd will listen on.
#   .
#   The address and port should be separated by a space and you can specify multiple
#   address-port combinations by separating them with spaces.
# d-i cvsd/listen string * 2401

### Description: Repositories to serve:
#   The whole idea of cvsd is to serve repositories. Specify a colon ':'
#   separated list of repositories to serve. The location of these repositories
#   is relative to the specified chroot jail (${rootjail}) and should start with a '/'.
#   .
#   The repositories here should be initialized by hand with something like
#   'cvs -d ${rootjail}/myrepos init' after which passwords can be set with
#   'cvsd-passwd ${rootjail}/myrepos anonymous'. See the file
#   /usr/share/doc/cvsd/README.gz for details on creating repositories.
# d-i cvsd/repositories string /demo:/myrepos

### Description: Resources of pserver processes to limit:
#   The pserver wrapper can be configured to limit the resource usage that
#   a pserver process can have. These resource limits will be set on each
#   pserver process and not on the wrapper.
#   .
#   Choose from the list the resources that you want to limit.
#   You will be asked to specify limits about every resource you selected here.
#   .
#   Note that not all resources may be available on all systems and that
#   resources may be system and kernel specific so use these with caution.
#   The results of exceeding the set limits may also be system specific
#   but will most likely stop the cvs process and close the connection
#   (may be problematic with write access to cvs repository).
# d-i cvsd/limits multiselect <choice(s)>
# Possible choices: coredumpsize, cputime, datasize, filesize, memorylocked, openfiles, maxproc, memoryuse, stacksize, virtmem

### Description: Maximum file size of a core dump:
#   Set this to 0 (zero) (should be the system default) to prevent core dumps.
#   Otherwise this limits the size of core dumps to the specified value.

#   This value may be specified with a suffix of 'b' (bytes), 'k'
#   (1024 bytes) or 'm' (1024*1024 bytes), where 'k' is the default.
# d-i cvsd/limit_coredumpsize string 0

### Description: Maximum amount of cpu time consumed:
#   This limits the number of cpu seconds the cvs process can use.
#   This will prevent too much cpu time from being allocated to a single connection.
#   .
#   This value can be formatted as 'mm:ss' or have a 'm' or 's'
#   suffix where 's' is default.
# d-i cvsd/limit_cputime string 1:00

### Description: Maximum size of program's data segment:
#   This limits the amount of memory the cvs program can use. This

#   This value may be specified with a suffix of 'b' (bytes), 'k'
#   (1024 bytes) or 'm' (1024*1024 bytes), where 'k' is the default.
# d-i cvsd/limit_datasize string 10m

### Description: Maximum size of files created:
#   This limits the maximum size of a file created by cvs.
#   Note that the cvs pserver process needs to be able to create
#   lock files and possibly write history or other files so
#   don't set this to 0 (zero).
#   .
#   This value may be specified with a suffix of 'b' (bytes), 'k'
#   (1024 bytes) or 'm' (1024*1024 bytes), where 'k' is the default.
# d-i cvsd/limit_filesize string 1m

### Description: Maximum amount of locked memory:
#   This limits the amount of memory the cvs process may lock.
#   cvs probably doesn't need to lock any memory at all.
#   .
#   This value may be specified with a suffix of 'b' (bytes), 'k'
#   (1024 bytes) or 'm' (1024*1024 bytes), where 'k' is the default.
# d-i cvsd/limit_memorylocked string 10m

### Description: Maximum number of open files:
#   This limits the number of files and connections that the cvs
#   process can have open at a single moment. The cvs process needs
#   to access quite a few files so don't set this too low.
# d-i cvsd/limit_openfiles string 1024

### Description: Maximum number of processes:
#   This limits the maximum number of processes that a single user may have.
#   cvs may need to spawn additional processes to run scripts or do subtasks
#   so don't set this too low.
# d-i cvsd/limit_maxproc string 20

### Description: Maximum size of resident memory:
#   This specifies the amount of physical memory a process may have.
#   .
#   This value may be specified with a suffix of 'b' (bytes), 'k'
#   (1024 bytes) or 'm' (1024*1024 bytes), where 'k' is the default.
# d-i cvsd/limit_memoryuse string 10m

### Description: Maximum stack size:
#   This limits the size of the stack.
#   .
#   This value may be specified with a suffix of 'b' (bytes), 'k'

### Description: Maximum amount of virtual memory allocated:
#   This limits the total amount of virtual memory a process may have allocated.
#   .
#   This value may be specified with a suffix of 'b' (bytes), 'k'
#   (1024 bytes) or 'm' (1024*1024 bytes), where 'k' is the default.
# d-i cvsd/limit_virtmem string 10m

### Description: Maximum number of threads:
#   This limits the number of threads that a single process may have.
#   .
#   This is not available under Linux so it is not in the list
#   for cvsd/limits. If Hurd has it it may be useful.
# d-i cvsd/limit_pthreads string 20

### Description: Remove chroot jail containing repositories?
#   The following directory is configured as a chroot jail for cvsd:
#     ${rootjail}
#   You may choose to remove the chroot jail but you will also lose all the
#   repositories inside the chroot jail. If you have not backed up your
#   repositories you want to keep do not remove it now and manually remove
#   it later once your repositories are safe.
#   .
#   If you do choose to remove the chroot directory, all directories under
#   it will be removed, even if they are on another file system.
#   .
#   If you choose to keep the chroot jail please note that the cvsd user and
#   group will be removed so uid and gid file information may no longer be
#   consistent.

### Description: Automatically configure cxref-cpp?
#   cxref-cpp is a cpp-like program used by cxref for better comment
#   processing and support.  Proper operation of cxref-cpp requires
#   configuration against the gcc and cpp versions you have installed on your
#   system.  These of course may change with each upgrade.  This package can
#   attempt to automatically keep track of your installed gcc and cpp versions
#   and reconfigure cxref-cpp accordingly, or it can leave such configuration
#   up to you.  In the latter case, you can run /usr/bin/cxref-cpp-configure
#   as root whenever you wish, and/or you can edit the file
#   /etc/cxref/cxref-cpp.defines by hand.  In the former case, the defines
#   file will be automatically updated every time the cxref package is

#   database via dbconfig-common, the questions related to remote
#   configuration are asked with a priority such that they are
#   skipped for most systems.
#   .
#   If you select this option, the default behavior will be to prompt you

#   If you are unsure, you should not select this option.
# d-i dbconfig-common/remote-questions-default boolean false

### Description: Remember database passwords permanently in debconf?
#   When you configure, upgrade, or remove applications with dbconfig-common,
#   administrator-level database passwords are needed. By default, these
#   passwords are not stored, so you will be prompted for them each time.
#   .
#   Alternatively the passwords can be permanently remembered in the debconf
#   database (which is protected by Unix file permissions), though this is
#   less secure and thus not the default setting.
#   .
#   If you would rather not be bothered for an administrative password
#   every time you upgrade a database application with dbconfig-common,
#   you should choose this option. Otherwise, you should refuse this option.
# d-i dbconfig-common/remember-admin-pass boolean false

### Description: Configure database for ${pkg} with dbconfig-common?
#   The ${pkg} package must have a database installed and configured before
#   it can be used. This can be optionally handled with dbconfig-common.
#   .
#   If you are an advanced database administrator and know that you want
#   to perform this configuration manually, or if your database has already
#   been installed and configured, you should refuse this option. Details on what
#   needs to be done should most likely be provided in /usr/share/doc/${pkg}.
#   .
#   Otherwise, you should probably choose this option.

### Description: Reinstall database for ${pkg}?
#   Since you are reconfiguring ${pkg}, you may also want to reinstall the
#   database which it uses.
#   .
#   If you wish to reinstall the database for ${pkg}, you should select
#   this option. If you do not wish to do so (if you are reconfiguring
#   the package for unrelated reasons), you should not select this option.
#   .
#   Warning: if you opt to reinstall the database and install it under a
#   name that already exists, the old database will be dropped without
#   further questions. In that case a backup of the original database is
#   made in /var/tmp/.

### Description: Perform upgrade on database for ${pkg} with dbconfig-common?
#   According to the maintainer for this package, database upgrade
#   operations need to be performed on ${pkg}. Typically, this is due to
#   changes in how a new upstream version of the package needs to store
#   its data.
#   .
#   If you want to handle this process manually, you should
#   refuse this option. Otherwise, you should choose this option.
#   During the upgrade, a backup of the database will be made in

#   associated with this package.
#   .
#   Please choose whether database removal and privilege revocation should be
#   handled with dbconfig-common.
#   .
#   If you choose this option, dbconfig-common will check if ${pkg} provided
#   scripts and database commands to undo package specific operations and run them
#   if they exist. Then it will ask if you want to delete the ${pkg} database and
#   revoke the standard privileges for the user of ${pkg}. If you don't want any

#   Below, you will be presented with the available choices.
#   .
#   If other database types are supported by ${pkg} but not shown here, the reason
#   for their omission is that the corresponding dbconfig-<database type> packages
#   are not installed. If you know that you want the package to use another
#   supported database type, your best option is to back out of the
#   dbconfig-common questions and opt out of dbconfig-common assistance for this
#   package for now. Install your preferred dbconfig-<database type> option from

#   revoke the privileges now.
#   .
#   If you no longer have need of the data being stored by ${pkg}, you
#   should choose this option. If you want to keep this data,

#   refuse this option. Either way, it won't affect your other databases.
# d-i dbconfig-common/purge boolean false

### Description: Back up the database for ${pkg} before upgrading?
#   The underlying database for ${pkg} needs to be upgraded as part of the

#   Configuring the database for ${pkg} requires the package ${dbpackage}
#   to be installed and configured first, which is not something that can be
#   checked for automatically.
#   .
#   Your options are:
#    * abort - Choose this when in doubt and install ${dbpackage} before
#      continuing with the configuration of this package. This causes the
#      installation of ${pkg} to fail for now.
#    * retry - Prompts once more with all the configuration questions
#      (including ones you may have missed due to the debconf priority
#      setting) and makes another attempt at performing the operation.
#      Choose this if you chose the wrong database type by mistake.
#    * ignore - Continues the operation ignoring dbconfig-common errors.
#      This will usually leave this package without a functional database.

### Description: ${dbvendor} database name for ${pkg}:
#   Please provide a name for the ${dbvendor} database to be used by ${pkg}.
# d-i dbconfig-common/db/dbname string <string>

### Description: ${dbvendor} username for ${pkg}:
#   Please provide a ${dbvendor} username for ${pkg} to register with the
#   database server. A ${dbvendor} user is not necessarily the same as a
#   system login, especially if the database is on a remote server.
#   .
#   This is the user which will own the database, tables, and other
#   objects to be created by this installation. This user will have
#   complete freedom to insert, change, or delete data in the database.
#   .
#   If your username contains an @, you need to specify the domain as well
#   (see below).
#   .
#   Advanced usage: if you need to define the domain that the user will log
#   in from, you can write "username@domain".
# d-i dbconfig-common/db/app-user string <string>

### Description: ${dbvendor} storage directory for ${pkg}:

# d-i dbconfig-common/mysql/app-pass password <password>

### Description: Name of the database's administrative user:
#   Please provide the name of the account with which this package should perform
#   administrative actions. This user is the one with the power to create new
#   database users.
#   .
#   For MySQL, this is almost always "root". Note that this is not the
#   same as the Unix login "root".
# d-i dbconfig-common/mysql/admin-user string <string>

### Description: Password of the database's administrative user:
#   Please provide the password for the administrative account "${dbadmin}" with
#   which this package should create its MySQL database and user.
# d-i dbconfig-common/mysql/admin-pass password <password>

### Description: Authentication plugin for MySQL database:
#   Database user accounts can be configured to use a variety of plugins
#   for authentication with MySQL. If the server default won't work with
#   this application, it is necessary to specify one that will. Please
#   select one from the list of available plugins. Leaving the selection
#   set to its original value should work unless a remote server is using
#   unpredictable defaults, but other options may not be supported by
#   ${pkg}. If problems arise, the package's documentation should give
#   hints; see /usr/share/doc/${pkg}/.
#   .
#   Your options are:
#    * default - use the default determined by the server.
#    * mysql_native_password - no MySQL authentication plugin is used.
#    * sha256_password - a more secure password encryption algorithm.
#    * caching_sha2_password - SHA2 plus an in-memory authentication cache.
# d-i dbconfig-common/mysql/authplugin select default
# Possible choices: default, mysql_native_password, sha256_password, caching_sha2_password

### Description: Connection method for PostgreSQL database of ${pkg}:
#   By default, ${pkg} will be configured to use a PostgreSQL server through
#   TCP/IP because that method works in most circumstances. To connect with a
#   different method, select the appropriate option from the choices here.
# d-i dbconfig-common/pgsql/method select TCP/IP
# Possible choices: Unix socket, TCP/IP, TCP/IP + SSL

### Description: PostgreSQL application password for ${pkg}:
#   Please provide a password for ${pkg} to register with the database
#   server. If left blank, a random password will be generated.
#   .
#   If you are using "ident" authentication, the supplied password will not
#   be used and can be left blank. Otherwise, PostgreSQL access may need to
#   be reconfigured to allow password-authenticated access.
# d-i dbconfig-common/pgsql/app-pass password <password>

### Description: Name of the database's administrative user:
#   Please provide the name of the account with which this package should perform
#   administrative actions. This user is the one with the power to create new
#   database users.
# d-i dbconfig-common/pgsql/admin-user string postgres

### Description: Password of your database's administrative user:
#   Please provide the password for the ${dbadmin} account with which this package
#   should perform administrative actions.
#   .
#   For a standard PostgreSQL installation, a database password is not
#   required, since authentication is done at the system level.
# d-i dbconfig-common/pgsql/admin-pass password <password>

### Description: Method for authenticating the PostgreSQL administrator:
#   PostgreSQL servers provide several different mechanisms for authenticating
#   connections. Please select what method the administrative user should use
#   when connecting to the server.
#   .
#   With "ident" authentication on the local machine, the server will
#   check that the owner of the Unix socket is allowed to connect.
#   PostgreSQL itself calls this peer authentication.
#   .
#   With "ident" authentication to remote hosts, RFC-1413-based ident is
#   used (which can be considered a security risk).
#   .
#   With "password" authentication, a password will be passed to the server
#   for use with some authentication backend (such as "MD5" or "PAM"). Note
#   that the password is still passed in the clear across network
#   connections if your connection is not configured to use SSL.
#   .
#   For a standard PostgreSQL installation running on the same host,
#   "ident" is recommended.
# d-i dbconfig-common/pgsql/authmethod-admin select ident
# Possible choices: ident, password

### Description: Method for authenticating PostgreSQL user:
#   PostgreSQL servers provide several different mechanisms for authenticating
#   connections. Please select what method the database user should use

#   connections if your connection is not configured to use SSL.
#   .
#   For a standard PostgreSQL installation running on the same host,
#   "password" is recommended, because typically the system username
#   doesn't match the database username.
# d-i dbconfig-common/pgsql/authmethod-user select password
# Possible choices: ident, password

### Description: Change PostgreSQL configuration automatically?
#   It has been determined that the database installation for ${pkg}
#   cannot be automatically accomplished without making changes to
#   the PostgreSQL server's access controls. It is suggested that this
#   be done by dbconfig-common when the package is installed. If
#   instead you would prefer to do it manually, the following line needs
#   to be added to your pg_hba.conf:
#   .
#   ${pghbaline}
# d-i dbconfig-common/pgsql/changeconf boolean false

### Description: Revert PostgreSQL configuration automatically?
#   As ${pkg} is now being removed, it may no longer be necessary to
#   have an access control entry in the PostgreSQL server's configuration.
#   While keeping such an entry will not break any software on the
#   system, it may be seen as a potential security concern. It is suggested
#   that this be done by dbconfig-common when the package is removed.
#   If instead you would prefer to do it manually, the following line
#   needs to be removed from your pg_hba.conf:
#   .
#   ${pghbaline}
# d-i dbconfig-common/pgsql/revertconf boolean false

### Description: Set up a database for this package?
#   No database has been set up for this package. Before continuing, you should
#   make sure you have the following information:
#   .
#    * the type of database that you want to use - generally the MySQL backend
#      (which is compatible with MariaDB) is a good choice, and other
#      implementations like PostgreSQL or SQLite are often problematic with
#      OpenStack (this depends on the service);
#    * the database server hostname (that server must allow TCP connections from
#      this machine);
#    * a username and password to access the database.
#   .
#   Note that if you plan on using a remote database server, you must first
#   configure dbconfig-common to do so (using dpkg-reconfigure dbconfig-common),
#   and the remote database server needs to be configured with adequate
#   credentials.
#   .
#   If some of these requirements are missing, do not choose this option. Run
#   with regular SQLite support instead.
#   .
#   You can change this setting later on by running "dpkg-reconfigure -plow".

### Description: Host name for this instance of Diaspora:
#   Please choose the host name which should be used to access this
#   instance of Diaspora.
#   .
#   This should be the fully qualified name as seen from the Internet, with
#   the domain name that will be used to access the pod.
#   .
#   If a reverse proxy is used, give the hostname that the proxy server
#   responds to.
#   .
#   This host name should not be modified after the initial setup because
#   it is hard-coded in the database.
# d-i diaspora-common/url string localhost

### Description: Enable https?
#   Enabling https means that an SSL/TLS certificate is required to access this
#   Diaspora instance (as Nginx will be configured to respond only to https
#   requests). A self-signed certificate is enough for local testing (and
#   can be generated using, for instance, the package easy-rsa), but will
#   not be accepted for federation with other Diaspora pods.
#   .
#   Some certificate authorities like Let's Encrypt (letsencrypt.org), StartSSL
#   (startssl.com) offer free SSL/TLS certificates that work with Diaspora;
#   however, certificates provided by CAcert will not work with Diaspora.
#   .
#   Nginx must be reloaded after the certificate and key files are made available
#   at /etc/diaspora/ssl. letsencrypt package may be used to automate interaction
#   with Let's Encrypt to obtain a certificate.
#   .
#   You can disable https if you want to access Diaspora only locally or you don't
#   want to federate with other diaspora pods.
# d-i diaspora-common/ssl boolean true

### Description: Use Let's Encrypt?
#   Symbolic links to certificate and key created using letsencrypt package
#   (/etc/letencrypt/live) will be added to /etc/diaspora/ssl if this option is
#   selected.
#   .
#   Otherwise, certificate and key files have to be placed manually to
#   /etc/diaspora/ssl directory as '<host name>-bundle.crt' and '<host name>.key'.
#   .
#   Nginx will be stopped, if this option is selected, to allow letsencrypt to use
#   ports 80 and 443 during domain ownership validation and certificate retrieval
#   step.
#   .
#   Note: letsencrypt does not have a usable nginx plugin currently, so
#   certificates must be renewed manually after 3 months, when current
#   letsencrypt certificate expire. If you choose this option, you will also be
#   agreeing to letsencrypt terms of service.

#   distcc can be run as a daemon, listening on port 3632 for incoming
#   connections.
#   .
#   You have the option of starting the distcc daemon automatically on the
#   computer startup. If in doubt, it's advised not to start it automatically
#   on startup. If you later change your mind, you can run: 'dpkg-reconfigure
#   distcc'.
# d-i distcc/daemon boolean false

### Description: Allowed client networks:
#   The distcc daemon implements access control based on the IP address of the
#   client, that is trying to connect. Only the hosts or networks listed
#   here are allowed to connect.
#   .
#   You can list multiple hosts and/or networks, separated by spaces. Hosts are
#   represented by their IP address, networks have to be in CIDR notation,
#   e.g. "192.168.1.0/24".
#   .
#   To change the list at a later point, you can run: 'dpkg-reconfigure distcc'.
# d-i distcc/daemon-allow string 127.0.0.1

### Description: Listen interfaces:
#   The distcc daemon can be bound to a specific network interface.
#   .
#   You probably want to choose the interface of your local network by entering
#   its IP address. If distccd should listen on all interfaces, just enter
#   nothing.
#   .
#   Be sure to protect distccd from unauthorized access, by being careful in
#   your choice of the listen interface and allowed networks. distccd should 
#   never be accessible from untrusted networks. If that is needed, secureshell
#   should be used instead of the daemon.
#   .
#   To change the address at a later point, you can run: 'dpkg-reconfigure distcc'.
# d-i distcc/daemon-listen string 127.0.0.1

### Description: Nice level:
#   You can start the distcc daemon with a nice level, to give it a low priority
#   compared to other processes. The start script will only accept values between
#   0 and 20.
#   .
#   To change this value at a later point, you can run: 'dpkg-reconfigure distcc'.
# d-i distcc/daemon-nice string 10

### Description: Maximum number of concurrent jobs:
#   You can tell the distcc daemon to accept a maximum number of jobs at a time.
#   This can be useful on systems that should stay interactive while they serve
#   as a distcc server. Usually, you will want to set this to a value matching
#   or doubling the number of cores on this system.
#   .
#   To change this value at a later point, you can run: 'dpkg-reconfigure distcc'.
# d-i distcc/daemon-jobs string 

### Description: Enable Zeroconf support?
#   distcc has Zeroconf support.
#   .
#   If you enable it here, please read /usr/share/doc/distcc/README.Debian to
#   learn how clients must be configured to make use of it. Also note, that
#   you need to install the dbus package, if you're going to use Zeroconf.

#   If you choose to configure now this will set up your system.
#   This operation needs to change the MAC address of your network cards,
#   it may work directly or it may require a reboot.
#   Please close all open connections such as ssh sessions and downloads
#   before you continue.
#   .
#   If you opt to configure later you can run this configure step again

#### dump1090-mutability_1.15~20180310.4a16df3+dfsg-8_amd64.deb
############################

### Description: Start dump1090 automatically?
#   dump1090 can be started automatically via an init-script.
#   Otherwise, the init-script does nothing; you must run dump1090 by hand.
#   .
#   You can modify the options used when automatically starting
#   dump1090 by running "dpkg-reconfigure dump1090-mutability" as root,
#   or by editing /etc/default/dump1090-mutability.
# d-i dump1090-mutability/auto-start boolean true

### Description: User to run dump1090 as:
#   When started automatically, dump1090 runs as an unprivileged system user.

### Description: RTL-SDR dongle to use:
#   If you have only one dongle connected, you can leave this blank.
#   .
#   Otherwise, you can provide the serial number (more reliable) or device
#   index (first device = 0, but the ordering is unpredictable) to choose
#   a particular dongle to use.
#   .
#   To run dump1090 in "net only" mode, specify the literal word "none".
# d-i dump1090-mutability/rtlsdr-device string

#   control the gain. If unsure, choose "max".
# d-i dump1090-mutability/rtlsdr-gain string max

### Description: RTL-SDR frequency correction, in PPM:
#   The oscillator in each RTL-SDL dongle is not perfectly accurate. You can
#   choose a correction factor, in parts-per-million, to correct for this. The
#   correction factor varies from dongle to dongle, and also varies with operating
#   temperature. You can find a suitable value with "rtl_test -p" or "kalibrate".
#   If you don't know the value for your dongle, choose 0.
# d-i dump1090-mutability/rtlsdr-ppm string 0

### Description: Fix detected CRC errors?

#   If the maximum range of the receiver is provided, dump1090 can filter
#   out impossible position reports that are due to aircraft that transmit
#   bad data.
#   .
#   Additionally, if the maximum range is larger than 180NM, when local
#   position decoding is used (when insufficient position messages
#   have been received for global position decoding), it is limited to
#   only those positions that would unambiguously decode to a single
#   position within the given receiver range.
#   .
#   This range should be the absolute maximum range - any position data
#   from further away will be entirely discarded!
# d-i dump1090-mutability/decode-max-range string 300

### Description: Portsfor AVR-format input connections (0 disables):

#   This package includes a configuration for lighttpd that does this.
#   To use that configuration, enable this option.
# d-i dump1090-mutability/use-lighttpd boolean true

### Description: Directory to write JSON aircraft state to:
#   As this can be written frequently, you should select a location
#   that is not on a sdcard. The default path under /run is on tmpfs
#   and will not write to the sdcard.
#   .
#   A blank path disables writing JSON state. This will also disable
#   the virtual radar map.
# d-i dump1090-mutability/json-dir string /run/dump1090-mutability

### Description: Interval between writing JSON aircraft state, in seconds:
#   dump1090 periodically write a list of aircraft, in JSON format, for use
#   by the virtual radar view when using an external webserver. This setting
#   controls the directory to write to.
#   .
#   Here you can control how often the JSON state is updated, which determines
#   how frequently the virtual radar view updates.
# d-i dump1090-mutability/json-interval string 1

### Description: Receiver location accuracy to show in the web interface:
#   dump1090 can provide the configured receiver location to the web map,
#   so that the map can show distances from the receiver.
#   .
#   For privacy reasons, if you are making the map publicly available you
#   may not want to show the exact location of the receiver. There are three
#   options available to control what is shown:
#   .
#   approximate: dump1090 will provide the receiver location rounded to the
#     nearest 0.01 degree of latitude and longitude. This gives a location
#     that is accurate to within about 0.5 - 1km.
#   .
#   exact: dump1090 will provide the exact receiver location.
#   .
#   none: dump1090 will not provide the receiver location at all; distance

### Description: Extra arguments to pass to dump1090:
#   Here you can add any extra arguments you want to pass to dump1090.
# d-i dump1090-mutability/extra-args string 

############################
#### durep_0.9-3.1_all.deb
############################

### Description: HTTP directory for supplementary files:
#   If this package shall provide disk usage information through a HTTP
#   CGI-service, it needs a public web directory containing additional files like
#   style sheet and images. This directory should be visible as '/durep' on the
#   web site where the durep.cgi page is located.
#   .
#   Due to FHS policy these files are not automatically installed to system
#   directories. To make them accessible, they can either be copied into a
#   location inside the HTTP root directory, or the web server needs to be
#   configured accordingly.
#   .
#   To configure the Apache webserver (for example), the following directive
#   creates the needed directory alias:
#   .
#         Alias /durep /usr/share/durep/www
#   .
#   To install supplementary files into another root directory please specify its
#   path here. The directory must already exist. A typical answer would be
#   '/var/www'. The subdirectory '/durep' with files will be created
#   automatically, the files will be installed from '/usr/share/durep/www' unless
#   they already exist.
# d-i durep/httpfileroot string 

### Description: Do you want to enable daily report generation?
#   If you wish, a daily script will create disk usage statistics of chosen
#   filesystems. They will be kept for seven days.

#   WARNING: with the default configuration, the statistics are stored in the
#   public httpd directory, /var/www/durep. This may breach the privacy of the
#   users.
# d-i durep/makereports boolean false

### Description: List of filesystems for durep reports:
#   To specify single filesystems to report on, enter their mount points
#   separated by spaces (eg. "/data /var"). A single dot (".") means scanning
#   of the whole UNIX filesystem tree.
# d-i durep/filesystems string .

############################
#### efingerd_1.6.5+nmu1_amd64.deb
############################

### Description: Permit users to have their own configurable finger replies?
#   You can decide if efingerd honours users' ~/.efingerd files.
#   .
#   If someone from network fingers given user, and the user has ~/.efingerd
#   file readable and executable for efingerd daemon, this file will be
#   executed and its output will be sent to the fingerer.
#   .
#   This can be either desired or not, depending on your system policy. In
#   particular, allowing .efingerd files allows users to cheat about their
#   real identity. However, efingerd can be configured to display users' full
#   names (from passwd) as the first line of the reply, so they cannot hide
#   themselves completely.
#   .
#   There is however a slight security concern: if you allow .efingerd files,
#   these files will be executed under efingerd UID, so malicious users gain
#   access to all files owned by efingerd - this becomes important when you
#   make efingerd to log into some files writable by the daemon, unless you
#   take appropriate precautions.
#   .
#   If you are the only user, or you trust your users, there is no reason to
#   disable .efingerd files (and this is probably a reason you want to install
#   efingerd for). However, if you expect your users to be nasty, you should
#   better think about protecting from them - in particular, if you enable
#   logging, make sure they cannot fiddle with the logfile - this is UP TO
#   YOU.
# d-i efingerd/allow_files boolean true

### Description: Display users' real names?
#   By default, efingerd displays users real names (from passwd) as the first
#   line of finger reply. You may want to suppress it, but if you allow the
#   use of .efingerd files at the same time, be aware that users can hide
#   their identity for the fingerer.
#   .
#   If in doubt, select this option.
# d-i efingerd/show_names boolean true

#### exim4-config_4.94.2-7_all.deb
############################

### Description: General type of mail configuration:
#   Please select the mail server configuration type that best meets your needs.
#   .
#   Systems with dynamic IP addresses, including dialup systems, should generally
#   be configured to send outgoing mail to another machine, called a 'smarthost'
#   for delivery because many receiving systems on the Internet block
#   incoming mail from dynamic IP addresses as spam protection.
#   .
#   A system with a dynamic IP address can receive its own mail, or local
#   delivery can be disabled entirely (except mail for root and postmaster).
# d-i exim4/dc_eximconfig_configtype select local delivery only; not on a network
# Possible choices: internet site; mail is sent and received directly using SMTP, mail sent by smarthost; received via SMTP or fetchmail, mail sent by smarthost; no local mail, local delivery only; not on a network, no configuration at this time

### Description: Really leave the mail system unconfigured?
#   Until the mail system is configured, it will be broken and cannot be
#   used. Configuration at a later time can be done either by hand or by
#   running 'dpkg-reconfigure exim4-config' as root.
# d-i exim4/no_config boolean true

### Description: System mail name:
#   The 'mail name' is the domain name used to 'qualify' mail addresses
#   without a domain name.
#   .
#   This name will also be used by other programs. It should be the
#   single, fully qualified domain name (FQDN).
#   .
#   Thus, if a mail address on the local host is foo@example.org,
#   the correct value for this option would be example.org.
#   .
#   This name won't appear on From: lines of outgoing messages if rewriting
#   is enabled.
# d-i exim4/mailname string <string>

### Description: Other destinations for which mail is accepted:
#   Please enter a semicolon-separated list of recipient domains for
#   which this machine should consider itself the final destination.
#   These domains are commonly called 'local domains'. The local hostname
#   (${fqdn}) and 'localhost' are always added to the list given here.
#   .
#   By default all local domains will be treated identically. If both
#   a.example and b.example are local domains, acc@a.example and
#   acc@b.example will be delivered to the same final destination. If
#   different domain names should be treated differently, it is
#   necessary to edit the config files afterwards.
# d-i exim4/dc_other_hostnames string 

### Description: Domains to relay mail for:
#   Please enter a semicolon-separated list of recipient domains for
#   which this system will relay mail, for example as a fallback MX or
#   mail gateway. This means that this system will accept mail for these
#   domains from anywhere on the Internet and deliver them according to
#   local delivery rules.
#   .
#   Do not mention local domains here. Wildcards may be used.
# d-i exim4/dc_relay_domains string 

### Description: Machines to relay mail for:
#   Please enter a semicolon-separated list of IP address ranges for
#   which this system will unconditionally relay mail, functioning as a
#   smarthost.
#   .
#   You should use the standard address/prefix format (e.g. 194.222.242.0/24
#   or 5f03:1200:836f::/48).
#   .
#   If this system should not be a smarthost for any other host, leave
#   this list blank.
# d-i exim4/dc_relay_nets string 

### Description: Visible domain name for local users:
#   The option to hide the local mail name in outgoing mail was enabled.
#   It is therefore necessary to specify the domain name this system
#   should use for the domain part of local users' sender addresses.
# d-i exim4/dc_readhost string <string>

### Description: IP address or host name of the outgoing smarthost:
#   Please enter the IP address or the host name of a mail server that
#   this system should use as outgoing smarthost. If the smarthost only
#   accepts your mail on a port different from TCP/25, append two colons
#   and the port number (for example smarthost.example::587 or
#   192.168.254.254::2525). Colons in IPv6 addresses need to be doubled.
#   .
#   If the smarthost requires authentication, please refer to
#   the Debian-specific README files in /usr/share/doc/exim4-base for
#   notes about setting up SMTP authentication.
# d-i exim4/dc_smarthost string <string>

### Description: Root and postmaster mail recipient:
#   Mail for the 'postmaster', 'root', and other system accounts needs to
#   be redirected to the user account of the actual system administrator.
#   .
#   If this value is left empty, such mail will be saved in /var/mail/mail,
#   which is not recommended.
#   .
#   Note that postmaster's mail should be read on the system to which it is
#   directed, rather than being forwarded elsewhere, so (at least one of)
#   the users listed here should not redirect their mail off this machine.
#   A 'real-' prefix can be used to force local delivery.
#   .
#   Multiple user names need to be separated by spaces.
# d-i exim4/dc_postmaster string <string>

### Description: IP-addresses to listen on for incoming SMTP connections:
#   Please enter a semicolon-separated list of IP addresses. The Exim SMTP
#   listener daemon will listen on all IP addresses listed here.
#   .
#   An empty value will cause Exim to listen for connections on all
#   available network interfaces.
#   .
#   If this system only receives mail directly from local services
#   (and not from other hosts), it is suggested to prohibit external
#   connections to the local Exim daemon. Such services include e-mail
#   programs (MUAs) which talk to localhost only as well as fetchmail.
#   External connections are impossible when 127.0.0.1 is entered here,
#   as this will disable listening on public network interfaces.
# d-i exim4/dc_local_interfaces string notset

### Description: Keep number of DNS-queries minimal (Dial-on-Demand)?
#   In normal mode of operation Exim does DNS lookups at startup, and when
#   receiving or delivering messages. This is for logging purposes and
#   allows keeping down the number of hard-coded values in the
#   configuration.
#   .
#   If this system does not have a DNS full service resolver available at
#   all times (for example if its Internet access is a dial-up line using
#   dial-on-demand), this might have unwanted consequences. For example,
#   starting up Exim or running the queue (even with no messages waiting)
#   might trigger a costly dial-up-event.
#   .
#   This option should be selected if this system is using Dial-on-Demand.
#   If it has always-on Internet access, this option should be disabled.
# d-i exim4/dc_minimaldns boolean false

### Description: Split configuration into small files?
#   The Debian exim4 packages can either use 'unsplit configuration', a
#   single monolithic file (/etc/exim4/exim4.conf.template) or 'split
#   configuration', where the actual Exim configuration files are built
#   from about 50 smaller files in /etc/exim4/conf.d/.
#   .
#   Unsplit configuration is better suited for large modifications and is
#   generally more stable, whereas split configuration offers a comfortable
#   way to make smaller modifications but is more fragile and might break
#   if modified carelessly.
#   .
#   A more detailed discussion of split and unsplit configuration can be
#   found in the Debian-specific README files in /usr/share/doc/exim4-base.
# d-i exim4/use_split_config boolean <choice>

### Description: Hide local mail name in outgoing mail?
#   The headers of outgoing mail can be rewritten to make it appear to have been
#   generated on a different system. If this option is chosen,
#   '${mailname}', 'localhost' and '${dc_other_hostnames}' in From, Reply-To,
#   Sender and Return-Path are rewritten.
# d-i exim4/hide_mailname boolean <choice>

### Description: Delivery method for local mail:
#   Exim is able to store locally delivered email in different formats.
#   The most commonly used ones are mbox and Maildir. mbox uses a single
#   file for the complete mail folder stored in /var/mail/. With Maildir
#   format every single message is stored in a separate file in ~/Maildir/.
#   .
#   Please note that most mail tools in Debian expect the local delivery
#   method to be mbox in their default.
# d-i exim4/dc_localdelivery select mbox format in /var/mail/
# Possible choices: mbox format in /var/mail/, Maildir format in home directory

#   It's recommended that you accept chainloading GRUB 2 from menu.lst, and
#   verify that the new GRUB 2 setup works before it is written to the MBR
#   (Master Boot Record).
#   .
#   Whatever your decision, you can replace the old MBR image with GRUB 2

#   .
#   If you're unsure which drive is designated as boot drive by your BIOS, it is

#   earlier version of GRUB 2 in the boot sector, it may be unable to load
#   modules or handle the current configuration file.
#   .
#   If you are already using a different boot loader and want to carry on

#   .
#   It seems likely that GRUB Legacy is no longer in use, and that you should
#   instead upgrade the GRUB 2 images on these disks and finish the conversion
#   to GRUB 2 by removing old GRUB Legacy files. If you do not upgrade these
#   GRUB 2 images, then they may be incompatible with the new packages and
#   cause your system to stop booting properly.
#   .

### Description: Set up a database for this package?
#   No database has been set up for this package. Before continuing, you should
#   make sure you have the following information:
#   .
#    * the type of database that you want to use - generally the MySQL backend
#      (which is compatible with MariaDB) is a good choice, and other
#      implementations like PostgreSQL or SQLite are often problematic with
#      OpenStack (this depends on the service);
#    * the database server hostname (that server must allow TCP connections from
#      this machine);
#    * a username and password to access the database.
#   .
#   Note that if you plan on using a remote database server, you must first
#   configure dbconfig-common to do so (using dpkg-reconfigure dbconfig-common),
#   and the remote database server needs to be configured with adequate
#   credentials.
#   .
#   If some of these requirements are missing, do not choose this option. Run
#   with regular SQLite support instead.

#   which case they will be matched against the request's Host header exactly
#   (case-insensitive, not including port). A value beginning with a period can be
#   used as a subdomain wildcard: ".example.com" will match example.com,
#   www.example.com, and any other subdomain of example.com. A value of "*" will
#   match anything; in this case you are responsible for providing your own

#   not check the link status. This is necessary for some broken network
#   drivers.
#   .
#   stop: this stops ifplugd. If the -q option is not given, ifplugd will stop
#   the interface. After resume, it will be restarted. This makes sense if you
#   use some mechanism (eg. guessnet or whereami) to detect your network
#   environment, which may have changed while suspending.

### Description: Allow ordinary users to run ip vrf exec using capabilities?
#   iproute2 can be used to configure and use Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF)
#   functionality in the  kernel.
#   This normally requires root permissions, but sometimes it's useful to allow
#   ordinary users to execute commands from inside a virtual routing and forwarding
#   domain. E.g. ip vrf exec examplevrf ping 10.0.0.1
#   .
#   The ip command supports dropping capabilities, making an exception for ip vrf exec.
#   The drawback of setting the permissions is that if in the unlikely case of a
#   security critical bug being found before the ip command has dropped capabilities
#   then it could be used by an attacker to gain root permissions.
#   It's up to you to decide about the trade-offs and select the best setting for your
#   system.
#   This will give cap_dac_override, cap_net_admin and cap_sys_admin to /bin/ip.

# d-i libnss-ldap/confperm boolean false

### Description: Distinguished name of the search base:
#   Please enter the distinguished name of the LDAP search base.  Many sites

# d-i shared/ldapns/ldap-server string ldap://127.0.0.1/

### Description: Special LDAP privileges for root?
#   This option will allow tools that perform requests to the nss system

### Description: Local encryption algorithm to use for passwords:
#   The PAM module can encrypt the password locally when changing it,
#   which is recommended:
#    * clear: no encryption. This should be chosen when LDAP servers
#      automatically encrypt the userPassword entry;
#    * crypt: make userPassword use the same format as the flat
#      local password database. If in doubt, you should choose this option;
#    * nds: use Novell Directory Services-style updating. The old
#      password is first removed, then updated;
#    * ad: Active Directory-style. This creates a Unicode password and
#      updates the unicodePwd attribute;
#    * exop: use the OpenLDAP password change extended operation to update the

# d-i libpam-ldap/binddn string cn=proxyuser,dc=example,dc=net

### Description: Allow LDAP admin account to behave like local root?
#   This option will allow password utilities that use PAM to
#   change local passwords.

############################
#### logtool_1.2.8-11_amd64.deb
############################

### Description: Manual configuration of logtool's database?
#   Logtool needs a database with regular expressions that describe logfile
#   entries that should be ignored, or considered less important. You can
#   write this database manually, or use the very flexible database in the
#   package logcheck-database for this purpose.
#   .
#   If you choose to use logcheck-database and already added values to the
#   files in /etc/logtool, these files will be replaced by symbolic links in
#   the logcheck database (although backups will be preserved). Make sure this
#   is not unwanted behaviour.
#   .
#   Reply positively to manually write a database, or negatively to use the
#   database from the package "logcheck-database".
#   .
#   Note: since logtool does not depend on this database (but instead
#   Recommends it), the default answer to this question is to manually
#   configure the database.
# d-i logtool/manual boolean true

### Description: Ignored template
#   No longer used template (although its value is read for upgrade purposes),
#   no need to translate it.
# d-i logtool/ignore-start select paranoid
# Possible choices: paranoid, server, workstation

### Description: Do you want to use the '${level}' level regular expressions?
#   The database in the logcheck-database package defines three levels:
#   paranoid, server, and workstation; and it also has a database for cracking,
#   violations, and ignored violations ('violations-ignore'). Logcheck allows you
#   to pick one of the levels, and ignores the rest.
#   .
#   Logtool, on the other hand, can use multiple databases, which either
#   specify lines that should be completely excluded from output
#   (/etc/logtool/exclude) or lines that should be given a specific color
#   (green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, brightcyan). There is also the
#   possibility to not create an exclude file, and use an 'include' style of
#   file instead; its use is not recommended. Last but not least, files that
#   are not excluded from output but that do not match any other regular
#   expression are colored red.
#   .
#   If you want to map the '${level}' level database of regular expressions to
#   one of the above specified options, then answer positively to this
#   question.
# d-i logtool/use-level boolean true

### Description: What do you want the ${level} level of regular expressions to do?
#   Please specify what you want to do with a line if it matches at least one
#   of the regular expressions in the ${level} level database. You have the
#   following options (note that regular expressions are matched on a
#   line-per-line basis):
#   .
#    * exclude: discard matching lines
#    * include: discard all but matching lines. Not recommended. Note that
#      this is mutually exclusive with 'exclude'.
#    * green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, brightcyan: give matching lines
#      the specified color.
#   .

#### muse_3.1.1-1_amd64.deb
############################

### Description: Do you want MusE to run with superuser rights?
#   For good timing, MusE needs to set the real time clock (/dev/rtc) to a
#   higher clock rate, and raise its scheduling priority. Usually, only the
#   root user is allowed to do so. MusE can be installed "suid-root", so
#   that it always runs with superuser capabilities. This is convenient, but
#   programming errors in MusE likely present a hazard for system security in
#   this setup.
#   .
#   File /usr/share/doc/muse/README.Debian summarizes several more secure
#   methods to meet the timing requirements, but they all require manual
#   configuration.
#   .
#   If you intend to use MusE for timing-sensitive recordings, and security
#   is of no concern on this computer, opt for the suid-root installation
#   by giving an affirmative answer to this question. Deny if unsure.

#   .
#   This package includes a script that runs during system boot, invoking
#   recover on any broken save files it finds. This makes it less likely
#   that users will need to run it themselves, so the default is to install
#   recover without the special permission bits required for that.
#   .
#   If you choose this option, unprivileged users will be able to run "recover".

#   .
#   You are advised to remove the entries if you don't plan on using LDAP for
#   name resolution any more. Not removing ldap from nsswitch.conf should, for
#   most services, not cause problems, but host name resolution could be affected
#   in subtle ways.

#   Do not do this if this system's root filesystem is on iSCSI.
#   .
#   If you do proceed, open-iscsi will try to unmount all filesystems on
#   iSCSI and log out from current sessions. If that fails (because a
#   filesystem is still in use), the kernel will keep the current
#   iSCSI sessions open, but will not perform any recovery if there is an
#   interruption of the network connection (or if the target is rebooted).
#   .
#   If you really intend to remove open-iscsi, you should abort here and
#   then stop open-iscsi:
#   .
#     service open-iscsi stop
#   .
#   If that did not clean up everything, manually umount all filesystems
#   that are on iSCSI, manually dismantle the storage stack, and only then
#   log out from all iSCSI sessions:
#   .

#   If you do not proceed, the preinstallation script will be aborted and
#   you will have the option to manually recover the iSCSI sessions. (Note
#   that aborting an upgrade is problematic if you are dist-upgrading your
#   entire system.) You may also recover the iSCSI sessions manually while

#   domain name of the site.
# d-i openafs-client/thiscell string <string>

### Description: Size of AFS cache in kB:
#   AFS uses an area of the disk to cache remote files for faster
#   access.  This cache will be mounted on /var/cache/openafs.  It is
#   important that the cache not overfill the partition it is located
#   on.  Often, people find it useful to dedicate a partition to their
#   AFS cache.
# d-i openafs-client/cachesize string 50000

### Description: Run Openafs client now and at boot?
#   Normally, most users who install the openafs-client package expect AFS to
#   be mounted automatically at boot.  However, if you are planning on
#   setting up a new cell or are on a laptop, you may not want it started at
#   boot time.  If you choose not to start AFS at boot, run
#   service openafs-client force-start to start the client when you wish
#   to run it.
# d-i openafs-client/run-client boolean true

### Description: Look up AFS cells in DNS?
#   In order to contact an AFS cell, you need the IP addresses of the cell's
#   database servers.  Normally, this information is read from
#   /etc/openafs/CellServDB.  However, if Openafs cannot find a cell in that
#   file, it can use DNS to look for AFSDB records that contain the
#   information.
# d-i openafs-client/afsdb boolean true

### Description: Encrypt authenticated traffic with AFS fileserver?
#   AFS provides a weak form of encryption that can optionally be used between
#   a client and the fileservers.  While this encryption is weaker than DES
#   and thus is not sufficient for highly confidential data, it does provide
#   some confidentiality and is likely to make the job of a casual attacker
#   significantly more difficult.
# d-i openafs-client/crypt boolean true

### Description: Dynamically generate the contents of /afs?
#   /afs generally contains an entry for each cell that a client can talk to.
#   Traditionally, these entries were generated by servers in the client's
#   home cell.  However, OpenAFS clients can generate the contents of /afs
#   dynamically based on the contents of /etc/openafs/CellServDB and DNS.
#   .
#   If you generate /afs dynamically, you may need to create
#   /etc/openafs/CellAlias to include aliases for common cells.  (The syntax
#   of this file is one line per alias, with the cell name, a space, and then
#   the alias for that cell.)
#   .
#   The Sparse option is the same as Yes except that, rather than populating
#   /afs from /etc/openafs/CellServDB immediately, cells other than the local
#   cell will not appear until they are accessed.  Cell aliases as set in the
#   CellAlias file are shown as normal, although they may appear to be
#   dangling links until traversed.
# d-i openafs-client/dynroot select Yes
# Possible choices: Yes, Sparse, No

### Description: Use fakestat to avoid hangs when listing /afs?
#   Because AFS is a global file space, operations on the /afs directory can
#   generate significant network traffic.  If some AFS cells are unavailable
#   then looking at /afs using ls or a graphical file browser may hang your
#   machine for minutes.  AFS has an option to simulate answers to these
#   operations locally to avoid these hangs.  You want this option under most
#   circumstances.
# d-i openafs-client/fakestat boolean true

#   created for you.
# d-i slapd/no_configuration boolean false

### Description: Dump databases to file on upgrade:
#   Before upgrading to a new version of the OpenLDAP server, the data from
#   your LDAP directories can be dumped into plain text files in the
#   standard LDAP Data Interchange Format.
#   .
#   Selecting "always" will cause the databases to be dumped
#   unconditionally before an upgrade. Selecting "when needed" will only

#   no dump will be done.
# d-i slapd/dump_database select when needed
# Possible choices: always, when needed, never

### Description: Directory to use for dumped databases:
#   Please specify the directory where the LDAP databases will be exported.
#   In this directory, several LDIF files will be created which correspond

# d-i slapd/dump_database_destdir string /var/backups/slapd-VERSION

### Description: Move old database?
#   There are still files in /var/lib/ldap which will probably break

#   scripts will move the old database files out of the way before
#   creating a new database.
# d-i slapd/move_old_database boolean true

### Description: Retry configuration?
#   The configuration you entered is invalid. Make sure that the DNS domain name
#   is syntactically valid, the field for the organization is not left empty and
#   the admin passwords match. If you decide not to retry the configuration the
#   LDAP server will not be set up. Run 'dpkg-reconfigure slapd' if you want to
#   retry later.
# d-i slapd/invalid_config boolean true

### Description: DNS domain name:
#   The DNS domain name is used to construct the base DN of the LDAP directory.
#   For example, 'foo.example.org' will create the directory with
#   'dc=foo, dc=example, dc=org' as base DN.
# d-i slapd/domain string <string>

### Description: Organization name:
#   Please enter the name of the organization to use in the base DN of your

### Description: Generated admin password:
#   Internal template, should never be displayed to users.
# d-i slapd/internal/generated_adminpw password <password>

### Description: Manual ppolicy schema update recommended
#   The new version of the Password Policy (ppolicy) overlay requires the
#   schema to define the pwdMaxRecordedFailure attribute type, which is not
#   present in the schema currently in use. It is recommended to abort the
#   upgrade now, and to update the ppolicy schema before upgrading slapd.
#   If replication is in use, the schema update should be applied on every
#   server before continuing with the upgrade.
#   .
#   An LDIF file has been generated with the changes required for the upgrade:
#   .
#   ${ldif}
#   .
#   so if slapd is using the default access control rules, these changes can be
#   applied (after starting slapd) by using the command:
#   .
#   ldapmodify -H ldapi:/// -Y EXTERNAL -f ${ldif}
#   .
#   If instead you choose to continue the installation, the new attribute
#   type will be added automatically, but the change will not be acted on

#   <root>). It should be a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) that you are
#   entitled to use.
#   .
#   For instance, to allow the local host to generate mail with addresses
#   such as <jrandomuser@example.org>, set the system mail name to
#   "example.org".
#   .
#   This mail name is used as the hostname in the SMTP greeting banner, and

############################
#### openssh-server_8.4p1-5+deb11u1_amd64.deb
############################

### Description: Disable SSH password authentication for root?
#   Previous versions of openssh-server permitted logging in as root over SSH
#   using password authentication. The default for new installations is now
#   "PermitRootLogin prohibit-password", which disables password authentication
#   for root without breaking systems that have explicitly configured SSH
#   public key authentication for root.
#   .
#   This change makes systems more secure against brute-force password
#   dictionary attacks on the root user (a very common target for such
#   attacks). However, it may break systems that are set up with the
#   expectation of being able to SSH as root using password authentication. You
#   should only make this change if you do not need to do that.
# d-i openssh-server/permit-root-login boolean true

### Description: Allow password authentication?
#   By default, the SSH server will allow authenticating using a password.
#   You may want to change this if all users on this system authenticate using
#   a stronger authentication method, such as public keys.
# d-i openssh-server/password-authentication boolean true

### Description: Set up a database for this package?
#   No database has been set up for this package. Before continuing, you should
#   make sure you have the following information:
#   .
#    * the type of database that you want to use - generally the MySQL backend
#      (which is compatible with MariaDB) is a good choice, and other

#    * the database server hostname (that server must allow TCP connections from
#      this machine);
#    * a username and password to access the database.
#   .
#   Note that if you plan on using a remote database server, you must first
#   configure dbconfig-common to do so (using dpkg-reconfigure dbconfig-common),

### Description: Should ncpd be started during boot?
#   Normally, ncpd - the daemon which handles the serial connection to a

#   another machine on the net and NEVER will use it locally, you can
#   disable this here.
# d-i plptools/ncpd/start boolean true

#   By default, the Psion is expected to be connected to the first serial
#   line (COM1:) of your machine. You can change this here.
# d-i plptools/ncpd/serial string /dev/ttyS0

### Description: IP address and port for ncpd:
#   If you intend to use the plptools front-ends from other machines, you
#   can specify 0.0.0.0 or the IP address of your machine here. Normal
#   users should keep the default 127.0.0.1!

#   Note, that THIS IS A SECURITY THREAT as no authentication and no
#   encryption is used! DO NOT USE THIS on machines which are accessible
#   from the Internet!
# d-i plptools/ncpd/listenat string 127.0.0.1

### Description: Should plpfuse be started during boot?
#   If plpfuse is started during boot-up, it will wait for a Psion being
#   connected and then automatically mount that Psion. Since this is
#   done as root, non-privileged users will not have access to the
#   mounted directory. If you have a single-user machine, you probably
#   want to start plpfuse manually when you need it.
# d-i plptools/plpfuse/start boolean false

### Description: Should plpprintd be started during boot?
#   If you intend to use the Psion's "Print via PC" feature, you can

# d-i pnm2ppa/printer_model select 710
# Possible choices: 710, 712, 720, 722, 820, 1000

### Description: Would you like debconf to create magicfilter filters?
#   Magicfilter is a customizable, extensible automatic printer filter. It
#   uses its own magic database (a la file(1)) to decide how to print out a
#   given print job.  Debconf can run the custom pnm2ppa script called
#   "update-magicfilter" to generate a default set of filters for color and
#   black-and-white printing.
#   .
#   The template filter is found in /usr/share/pnm2ppa/ as
#   "pnm2ppa-magicfilter.in".  update-magicfilter uses sed to replace
#   @OPTIONS@ from the template and place the resulting filters in
#   /etc/magicfilter.  Additionally, symbolic links are created from the
#   generated pnm2ppa filters to pbm2ppa filters (the deprecated
#   predecessor to pnm2ppa).
#   .
#   The only thing left for you to do is run magicfilterconfig to
#   generate your /etc/printcap.

### Description: Add a 'mydomain' entry in main.cf for upgrade?
#   Postfix version 2.3.3-2 and later require changes in main.cf.
#   Specifically, mydomain must be specified, since hostname(1) is not
#   a fully qualified domain name (FQDN).
#   .

# d-i postfix/mydomain_warning boolean <choice>

### Description: Set smtpd_relay_restrictions in main.cf for upgrade?
#   Postfix version 2.10 adds smtpd_relay_restrictions, to separate relaying

# d-i postfix/compat_conversion_warning boolean true

### Description: Update master.cf for merged lmtp/smtp binary?
#   This upgrade of postfix drops the "lmtp" symlink, and your configuration

#   will be aborted if you do not allow the change.
# d-i postfix/lmtp_retired_warning boolean true

### Description: Update main.cf for daemon_directory change?
#   This upgrade of postfix changes where daemons are located, and your postfix

### Description: Correct retry entry in master.cf for upgrade?
#   Postfix version 2.4 requires that the retry service be added to master.cf.
#   .
#   Failure to fix this will result in a broken mailer. Decline this option
#   to abort the upgrade, giving you the opportunity to add this configuration
#   yourself. Accept this option to automatically make master.cf compatible
#   with Postfix 2.4 in this respect.
# d-i postfix/retry_upgrade_warning boolean <choice>

### Description: Correct tlsmgr entry in master.cf for upgrade?
#   Postfix version 2.2 has changed the invocation of tlsmgr.

#     The only delivered mail is the mail for local users. There is no network.
# d-i postfix/main_mailer_type select Internet Site
# Possible choices: No configuration, Internet Site, Internet with smarthost, Satellite system, Local only

### Description: System mail name:
#   The "mail name" is the domain name used to "qualify" _ALL_ mail addresses
#   without a domain name. This includes mail to and from <root>: please do not
#   make your machine send out mail from root@example.org unless root@example.org
#   has told you to.
#   .
#   This name will also be used by other programs. It should be the

### Description: Force synchronous updates on mail queue?
#   If synchronous updates are forced, then mail is processed more slowly.
#   If not forced, then there is a remote chance of losing some mail if
#   the system crashes at an inopportune time, and you are not using a
#   journaled filesystem (such as ext3).
# d-i postfix/chattr boolean false

### Description: Local networks:
#   Please specify the network blocks for which this host should relay mail.
#   The default is just the local host, which is needed by some mail user agents.
#   The default includes local host for both IPv4 and IPv6. If just connecting
#   via one IP version, the unused value(s) may be removed.
#   .
#   If this host is a smarthost for a block of machines, you need to specify the
#   netblocks here, or mail will be rejected rather than relayed.
#   .
#   To use the postfix default (which is based on the connected subnets), leave
#   this blank.
# d-i postfix/mynetworks string 127.0.0.0/8 [::ffff:127.0.0.0]/104 [::1]/128

### Description: Mailbox size limit (bytes):

### Description: Root and postmaster mail recipient:
#   Mail for the 'postmaster', 'root', and other system accounts needs to
#   be redirected to the user account of the actual system administrator.
#   .
#   If this value is left empty, such mail will be saved in /var/mail/nobody,
#   which is not recommended.
#   .
#   Mail is not delivered to external delivery agents as root.
#   .
#   If you already have a /etc/aliases file and it does not have an entry

#### pure-ftpd-common_1.0.49-4.1_all.deb
############################

### Description: Run pure-ftpd from inetd or as a standalone server:
#   Pure-ftpd can be run from inetd or as a standalone daemon. Using inetd is
#   a suitable option for small ftp servers because the inetd super-server
#   will only launch pure-ftpd to handle incoming connections. Standalone
#   operation is more efficient for busy ftp sites.
#   .
#   Keep in mind that a few options only work in standalone mode, such as
#   limiting connections per-IP and binding the server to a specific IP
#   address.
# d-i pure-ftpd/standalone-or-inetd select standalone
# Possible choices: inetd, standalone

### Description: Do you want pure-ftpwho to be installed setuid root?
#   The pure-ftpwho program only works with root privileges. Since it's a
#   fairly trivial program, this poses little security risk. Still, it is only
#   recommended that you install any program setuid root if you need it.
#   .
#   You can always change your mind later by reconfiguring this package with
#   "dpkg-reconfigure pure-ftpd-common".
# d-i pure-ftpd/ftpwho-setuid boolean false

### Description: Enable virtual chroots ?
#   Chrooted users are usually restricted to their home directory.
#   With virtual chroots symbolic links are always followed, even if they are

### Description: Old database format detected
#   It seems that you are trying to upgrade Pwman3 from version 0.5.x or older.
#   The database is not compatible with the new database format. Before
#   upgrading you need to export your database to a CSV with:
#   .
#     pwman> export
#   .
#   That will create a CSV file located in $HOME/pwman-export.csv. Once exported,
#   you will have to rename your old database to keep a backup of it:
#   .
#     mv $HOME/pwman/pwman.db $HOME/pwman/pwman-old.db
#   .
#   Then you can restart the package upgrade.
#   Once the upgrade will be finished, you will be able to import the CSV file
#   previously generated:
#   .
#     pwman3 -i $HOME/pwman-export.csv \;
#   .
#   Don't forget to remove the CSV file when the import succeeded (the passwords

#### qpsmtpd_0.94-4_all.deb
############################

### Description: Enable qpsmtpd startup at boot time?
#   Because most MTAs in Debian listen on one or all network interfaces by
#   default, when first installed qpsmtpd cannot normally be started.
#   .
#   Before enabling qpsmtpd, you must first configure your local MTA not to
#   bind to the SMTP TCP port on at least one interface.  The most common
#   approach is to leave your MTA listening on the loopback interface
#   (127.0.0.1), with qpsmtpd listening on the external interface. 
#   Instructions for configuring common MTAs to work with qpsmtpd can be found
#   after installation in /usr/share/doc/qpsmtpd/README.Debian.
#   .
#   Once you have adjusted your MTA configuration, you can enable qpsmtpd by
#   restarting this configuration, by running 'dpkg-reconfigure qpsmtpd'.
# d-i qpsmtpd/startup_enabled boolean false

### Description: Qpsmtpd server type:
#   Qpsmtpd supports two process models for handling connections.  The
#   'forkserver' model uses a single process when idle, and forks new processes
#   to handle connections.  This uses less memory but slightly reduces
#   server throughput.  The 'prefork' model keeps a pool of idle processes
#   available to handle new connections, offering slightly better performance
#   at the cost of more memory.
# d-i qpsmtpd/server_type select forkserver
# Possible choices: forkserver, prefork

### Description: Addresses on which to listen for incoming SMTP connections:
#   Enter one or more of your local IP addresses, separated by spaces, on
#   which qpsmtpd should listen for incoming SMTP connections.  If you leave
#   this setting empty, qpsmtpd will listen on all interfaces available at
#   startup time.
#   .
#   If you intend to use qpsmtpd to spool deliveries from remote hosts into a
#   local MTA, you may wish to have qpsmtpd listen on all external interfaces,
#   while leaving your local MTA listening on the loopback device (127.0.0.1).
#   .
#   For each interface you may optionally specify a port to listen on instead
#   of the default port 25; do this by appending :<port> to the interface, as
#   in "127.0.0.1:2526".
# d-i qpsmtpd/listen_interfaces string unset

### Description: Queueing method for accepted mail:
#   Select the method for queueing mail once it's been delivered via SMTP.  If
#   you deliver your mail locally, choose the method corresponding to the
#   installed MTA (the installer will try to pick the correct default.)
#   .
#   Select "proxy" if you'd like qpsmtpd to act as an SMTP proxy for another
#   MTA (local or remote).  You will then be prompted to enter a destination
#   host.
#   .
#   Select "maildir" to have qpsmtpd deliver into a local maildir-format spool
#   instead of queueing it for delivery (e.g. if you're setting up a
#   spamtrap.)
#   .
#   If you select "none," no queueing will be done at all, unless you manually
#   configure it yourself by editing /etc/qpsmtpd/plugins.
# d-i qpsmtpd/queue_plugin select <choice>
# Possible choices: exim, postfix, qmail, proxy, maildir, none

### Description: Destination host/port for SMTP proxy delivery:
#   To have qpsmtpd act as an SMTP proxy for another host, supply the hostname
#   or IP address of that host here.  You can optionally add a port number
#   after a colon, such as "localhost:25".
# d-i qpsmtpd/queue_smtp_proxy_destination string localhost

### Description: Destination Maildir for maildir-type delivery:
#   To have qpsmtpd deliver received mail into a local maildir-format spool,
#   enter a location for that maildir.  A maildir will be created in that
#   location if it does not exist already.
# d-i qpsmtpd/queue_maildir_destination string /var/spool/qpsmtpd/Maildir

### Description: Proceed without a queueing plugin selected?
#   By selecting "none" as a queueing plugin, you have disabled local queueing
#   of inbound mail.  This will prevent any mail being spooled by qpsmtpd
#   until you manually configure a queueing method.  Any hosts attempting to
#   deliver mail to you will receive 4xx soft-failure messages until then, at
#   the potential cost of wasted bandwidth and eventual bouncing of possibly
#   legitimate mail.
#   .
#   To configure queueing manually, edit /etc/qpsmtpd/plugins and select one
#   of the queueing methods listed there.  If you didn't see your installed
#   MTA in the list and aren't sure what to do, pick "Cancel" here and
#   select the SMTP proxy method instead, configuring it to proxy into your
#   MTA on a suitable local address/port.
# d-i qpsmtpd/queue_none_confirm boolean <choice>

### Description: Destination domain(s) to accept mail for (blank for none):
#   Enter a list of domain name(s) for which qpsmtpd should accept mail,
#   separated by spaces.  This list should include any hostname or domain name
#   for which you intend to accept delivery locally, as well as any recipient
#   domains for which you intend to act as a mail relay.  In general, if you
#   intend to spool received mail into a local MTA, this list should be the
#   same as used for that MTA (the installer will attempt to extract that
#   setting as a default.)
#   .
#   If you prefer to manage this list manually, leave the entry blank and edit
#   the file /etc/qpsmtpd/rcpthosts.
# d-i qpsmtpd/rcpthosts string unset

#   .
#   This setting corresponds to the $rtname configuration variable.
# d-i request-tracker4/rtname string <string>

### Description: Identifier for this RT instance:
#   In addition to its name, every installation of Request Tracker must also have
#   a unique identifier. It is used when linking between RT installations.
#   .
#   It should be a persistent DNS domain relating to your installation, for
#   example example.org, or perhaps rt.example.org. It should not be changed
#   during the lifetime of the RT database, so it is recommended not to use the
#   default value of the system hostname. Therefore, if you plan to restore

### Description: Handle RT_SiteConfig.pm permissions?
#   The RT web interface needs access to the database password, stored in the
#   main RT configuration file. Because of this, the file is made readable by
#   the www-data group in normal setups. This may have security implications.
#   .
#   If you reject this option, the file will be readable only by root, and
#   you will have to set up appropriate access controls yourself.

#### resolvconf_1.87_all.deb
############################

### Description: Prepare /etc/resolv.conf for dynamic updates?
#   The resolvconf package contains the infrastructure required for

#   link will be created; the existing /etc/resolv.conf file will be
#   preserved as /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/original, and will be
#   restored if this package is removed.
#   .
#   Declining this option will prevent future installations from
#   recreating the symbolic link and therefore the resolver configuration
#   file will not be dynamically updated. Dynamic updating can then be
#   activated following instructions in the README file.
#   .
#   The presence of resolvconf can affect the behavior of other programs,
#   so it should not be left installed if unconfigured.
# d-i resolvconf/linkify-resolvconf boolean true

### Description: Append original file to dynamic file?
#   If the original static resolver configuration file (/etc/resolv.conf)
#   contains name server addresses, those addresses should be listed on
#   "dns-nameservers" lines in /etc/network/interfaces. For more
#   information, please consult the resolvconf(8) man page and the
#   README file.
#   .
#   Until /etc/network/interfaces has been edited and the affected
#   interfaces brought down and up again, the name server addresses will
#   not be included in the dynamically generated resolver configuration
#   file.
#   .
#   If you choose this option, a temporary workaround will be put in
#   place: a symbolic link will be created (if it does not already exist)
#   from /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/tail to
#   /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/original. This will cause the whole of
#   that original resolver configuration file to be appended to the

#   .
#   After the required "dns-nameservers" lines have been added to
#   /etc/network/interfaces, the /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/tail link

### Description: Enable saned as a standalone server?
#   The saned server, when enabled, makes scanners available over the network.

#   There are two ways of running saned:
#    - as an inetd service, started by the inetd superserver. In this mode,
#   saned is started on demand when a client connects to the server;
#    - as a standalone daemon, started at system boot. In this mode, saned
#   runs in the background all by itself and listens for client connections.
#   .
#   When run in standalone mode, saned advertises itself on the network and
#   can be detected automatically by the SANE clients with no configuration
#   on the client side. You still need to configure the server to accept
#   connections from your clients. This feature is experimental and requires

### Description: Interface(s) which Snort should listen on:
#   This value is usually "eth0", but this may be inappropriate in some
#   network environments; for a dialup connection "ppp0" might be more
#   appropriate (see the output of "/sbin/ifconfig").
#   .
#   Typically, this is the same interface as the "default route" is on. You can
#   determine which interface is used for this by running "/sbin/route -n"
#   (look for "0.0.0.0").

#   It is also not uncommon to use an interface with no IP address
#   configured in promiscuous mode. For such cases, select the

#   that should be inspected, enable promiscuous mode later on and make sure
#   that the network traffic is sent to this interface (either connected
#   to a "port mirroring/spanning" port in a switch, to a hub, or to a tap).

# d-i snort/address_range string 192.168.0.0/16

### Description: Should Snort disable promiscuous mode on the interface?
#   Disabling promiscuous mode means that Snort will only see packets

#   If your remote SMTP server listens on a port other than 25 (Standard/RFC)
#   then set it here.
# d-i ssmtp/port string 25

### Description: Domain to masquerade as:
#   ssmtp will use "username@REWRITEDOMAIN" as the default From: address
#   for outgoing mail which contains only a local username.
# d-i ssmtp/rewritedomain string <string>

### Description: Name to store in /etc/mailname:
#   This is the portion of the address after the '@' sign to be shown on

# d-i ssmtp/hostname string <string>

### Description: Allow override of From: line in email header?
#   A "positive" response will permit local users to enter any From: line
#   in their messages without it being mangled, and cause ssmtp to rewrite
#   the envelope header with that address. A "negative" response will
#   disallow this, and use only the default address or addresses set in

#### strongswan-starter_5.9.1-1+deb11u3_amd64.deb
############################

### Description: Restart strongSwan now?
#   Restarting strongSwan is recommended, since if there is a security fix, it
#   will not be applied until the daemon restarts. Most people expect the daemon
#   to restart, so this is generally a good idea. However, this might take down
#   existing connections and then bring them back up, so if you are using such
#   a strongSwan tunnel to connect for this update, restarting is not recommended.
# d-i strongswan/restart boolean true

### Description: Use an X.509 certificate for this host?
#   An X.509 certificate for this host can be automatically created or imported.
#   It can be used to authenticate IPsec connections to other hosts
#   and is the preferred way of building up secure IPsec connections. The other
#   possibility would be to use shared secrets (passwords that are the same on
#   both sides of the tunnel) for authenticating a connection, but for a larger
#   number of connections, key based authentication is easier to administer and
#   more secure.
#   .
#   Alternatively you can reject this option and later use the command
#   "dpkg-reconfigure strongswan" to come back.
# d-i strongswan/install_x509_certificate boolean false

### Description: Methods for using a X.509 certificate to authenticate this host:
#   It is possible to create a new X.509 certificate with user-defined settings
#   or to import an existing public and private key stored in PEM file(s) for
#   authenticating IPsec connections.
#   .
#   If you choose to create a new X.509 certificate you will first be asked
#   a number of questions which must be answered before the creation can start.
#   Please keep in mind that if you want the public key to get signed by
#   an existing Certificate Authority you should not select to create a
#   self-signed certificate and all the answers given must match exactly the
#   requirements of the CA, otherwise the certificate request may be rejected.
#   .
#   If you want to import an existing public and private key you will be
#   prompted for their filenames (which may be identical if both parts are stored
#   together in one file). Optionally you may also specify a filename where the
#   public key(s) of the Certificate Authority are kept, but this file cannot
#   be the same as the former ones. Please also be aware that the format for the
#   X.509 certificates has to be PEM and that the private key must not be encrypted
#   or the import procedure will fail.
# d-i strongswan/how_to_get_x509_certificate select create
# Possible choices: create, import

### Description: File name of your PEM format X.509 certificate:
#   Please enter the location of the file containing your X.509 certificate in
#   PEM format.
# d-i strongswan/existing_x509_certificate_filename string <string>

### Description: File name of your PEM format X.509 private key:
#   Please enter the location of the file containing the private RSA key
#   matching your X.509 certificate in PEM format. This can be the same file
#   that contains the X.509 certificate.
# d-i strongswan/existing_x509_key_filename string <string>

### Description: File name of your PEM format X.509 RootCA:
#   Optionally you can now enter the location of the file containing the X.509
#   Certificate Authority root used to sign your certificate in PEM format. If you
#   do not have one or do not want to use it please leave the field empty. Please
#   note that it's not possible to store the RootCA in the same file as your X.509
#   certificate or private key.
# d-i strongswan/existing_x509_rootca_filename string <string>

### Description: Please enter which length the created RSA key should have:
#   Please enter the length of the created RSA key. It should not be less than
#   1024 bits because this should be considered unsecure and you will probably
#   not need anything more than 4096 bits because it only slows the
#   authentication process down and is not needed at the moment.
# d-i strongswan/rsa_key_length string 2048

### Description: Create a self-signed X.509 certificate?
#   Only self-signed X.509 certificates can be created
#   automatically, because otherwise a Certificate Authority is needed to sign
#   the certificate request. If you choose to create a self-signed certificate,
#   you can use it immediately to connect to other IPsec hosts that support
#   X.509 certificate for authentication of IPsec connections. However, using
#   strongSwan's PKI features requires all certificates to be signed by a single
#   Certificate Authority to create a trust path.
#   .
#   If you do not choose to create a self-signed certificate, only the RSA
#   private key and the certificate request will be created, and you will
#   have to sign the certificate request with your Certificate Authority.
# d-i strongswan/x509_self_signed boolean true

### Description: Country code for the X.509 certificate request:
#   Please enter the two-letter code for the country the server resides in
#   (such as "AT" for Austria).
#   .
#   OpenSSL will refuse to generate a certificate unless this is a valid
#   ISO-3166 country code; an empty field is allowed elsewhere in the X.509
#   certificate, but not here.
# d-i strongswan/x509_country_code string AT

### Description: State or province name for the X.509 certificate request:
#   Please enter the full name of the state or province the server resides in
#   (such as "Upper Austria").
# d-i strongswan/x509_state_name string 

### Description: Locality name for the X.509 certificate request:
#   Please enter the locality the server resides in (often a city, such
#   as "Vienna").
# d-i strongswan/x509_locality_name string 

### Description: Organization name for the X.509 certificate request:
#   Please enter the organization the server belongs to (such as "Debian").
# d-i strongswan/x509_organization_name string 

### Description: Organizational unit for the X.509 certificate request:
#   Please enter the organizational unit the server belongs to (such as
#   "security group").
# d-i strongswan/x509_organizational_unit string 

### Description: Common Name for the X.509 certificate request:
#   Please enter the Common Name for this host (such as
#   "gateway.example.org").
# d-i strongswan/x509_common_name string 

### Description: Email address for the X.509 certificate request:
#   Please enter the email address of the person or organization
#   responsible for the X.509 certificate.
# d-i strongswan/x509_email_address string 

### Description: Enable opportunistic encryption?
#   This version of strongSwan supports opportunistic encryption (OE), which stores
#   IPSec authentication information in
#   DNS records. Until this is widely deployed, activating it will
#   cause a significant delay for every new outgoing connection.
#   .
#   You should only enable opportunistic encryption if you are sure you want it.
#   It may break the Internet connection (default route) as the daemon starts.
# d-i strongswan/enable-oe boolean false
